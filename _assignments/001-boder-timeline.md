In the clip the focus is most on the creation and transformation of David Boder’s collection. But the motives to create such a resource and the expertise and mindset needed to envision such a project, seem very much influenced by David Boder’s  course of life and the political-technological- scientific context in which he operated. This assignment introduces you to a digital tool with which you can create a timeline that can be populate and shared with others. The purpose is to make you aware of the connection between the creation of a historical source, a database with 121 audio interviews on  experiences of concentration camp survivors, and the world in which its creator,  a Jewish Latvian scholar in psychology who had to flee his country, was educated and influenced. 
What was going on during his lifetime with regard to personal drawbacks, technological innovation, scientific progress and  political conflict?
