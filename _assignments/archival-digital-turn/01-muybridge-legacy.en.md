Eadweard Muybridge laid the basis for the development of cinematography by producing photos of a trotting horse with a series of
cameras that "snapped" as soon as the horse passed through an electrical control. The silhouttes were transferred to glass plates, that would be turned round at great speed, simulating a continous movement. This device was called a [zoopraxiscope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoopraxiscope). Many artists, photographers and scholars were inspired by his work, but the impact and dissemination of his legacy was magnified by the introduction of digital technology and the web in the late 1990s.
This assignment looks at the relationship between Muybridge’s original glass plates, and what can be retrieved,
viewed/read and re-used on the web. The San Francisco Museum of Modern Art has been created [an animation](https://youtu.be/wNU7sXkZmSw)on this subject. Watch it for a concise overview of Eadweard Muybridge and his achievements.

### 1.a The original technology used by Muybridge | 20 min
<!-- section-contents -->
To capture images, Muybridge introduced a new technology.
-  You are going to consult the Wayback Machine. This is an archive for websites, that takes snapshots of websites and stores them. But it also publishes analogue sources that have been digitised. By clicking on this link you will retrieve a digital copy of an illustration of Muybridge's accomplishments in 1878,  [Muybridge’s experiment with the horse Sally Gardner](https://web.archive.org/web/20120730172726/http://popartmachine.com/artwork/LOC+1071481/0/The-horse-in-motion,-illus.-by-Muybridge.-) 

- Consult the document, use the + sign if the letters are soo small. Note down the name of the device for which Muybridge obtained a patent in your template. 

- Consult the digital copy of another relevant contemporary source, [the catalogue of an exhibit on Muybridge held at the Stanford University Museum of art in 1972](https://archive.org/stream/eadweardmuybridg00maye/eadweardmuybridg00maye_djvu.txt)
It has been digitised and published online by the Wayback Machine/Internet Archive in 2012, with the support of the Digital Library Project. Although the document is a catalogue of an exhibition, it consist only of texts that have been processed with [optical character recognition.](https://youtu.be/jO-1rztr4O0) The most probable reason for not including the images is that [copyright issues](https://youtu.be/1DKm96Ftfko) played a role. 
The digitized text can be searched with ["Control F"](https://blog.spinweb.net/5-reasons-why-control-f-is-your-best-friend-for-productivity). This means that you can directly trace the context of a name or term, without first having to read the entire document. Usually it is enough to read what comes before and after the term. If that does not suffice, read the entire section of a text, to figure out what kind of contribution it is (an essay, an interview, an article, a quote, a chapter from a book).

The digitized catalogue contains several contributions by experts. Let's see whether you are able to use "Control F" in an efficient way.
Answer the following questions: 
- What was the relationship between Muybridge and the French inventor Marey? Who can claim to be the real inventor? 
- What kind of drama affected Muybridge's 'private life'?  
- What is the difference between a zoopraxiscope, a zootrope, a magic lantern and a phonograph? 
- Try to find out what is specific about each gadget, if you can't distill that from the text, conduct additional webresearch. 
- Note down your findings in your template.

### 1.b Re-use of Muybridge’s material: the father of the *GIF*? | 30 min
<!-- section-contents -->

Muybridge has been referred to as the father of the *GIF*, a very recent development related to digital technology. This comparison points to how existing principles are adapted and re-used in new forms and raises the question of whether we can speak about an original work of art or innovation. The same applies of course with regard to historical sources.  

-  Watch this clip created by video activist Kirby Ferguson about how creation is based on the re-use of older material: [Everything is a re-mix](https://vimeo.com/kirbyferguson/remix2015)
- Find out about [the origin of the GIF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GIF) is  
- Below you will find a list of artists/photographers that have been inspired by Muybridge. Open the links to collect information for your table in the template.
- What kind of organisations/artists/scholars re-used aspects of Muybridge’s work/life/art?
- In what context? List the objective, the time frame and the location
- Can you identify one element of Muybridge's work that has been a major source of inspiration and has been reused?
