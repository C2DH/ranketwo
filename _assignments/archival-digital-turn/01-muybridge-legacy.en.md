Eadweard Muybridge laid the basis for the development of cinematography by making photos of a trotting horse with a series of
cameras and showing them with a [zoopraxiscope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoopraxiscope). Many artists, photographers and scholars were inspired by his work, but the impact and dissemination of his legacy was magnified by the introduction of digital technology and the web in the late 1990s.
This assignment is meant to study the relation between Muybridge’s original glass plates, and what can be retrieved,
viewed/read and re-used on the web.
[This animation](https://youtu.be/wNU7sXkZmSw) has been created by the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. Watch it to get a concise picture of Eadweard Muybridge and his achievements.

### 1.a The original technology
<!-- section-contents -->
For capturing images, Muybridge had to rely on the technologies that were available at that time.
- Try to find out what he used by consulting the sources below.
- Visit the wayback machine, an archive for websites, where you can find a digital copy of a contemporary illustration from 1878,  
of [Muybridge’s experiment with the horse Sally Gardner](https://web.archive.org/web/20120730172726/http://popartmachine.com/artwork/LOC+1071481/0/The-horse-in-motion,-illus.-by-Muybridge.-)  
- Consult the digital copy of another contemporary relevant source, [the catalogue of an exhibit on Muybridge held in Stanford in 1972](https://archive.org/stream/eadweardmuybridg00maye/eadweardmuybridg00maye_djvu.txt)
It has also been digitized by the wayback machine/Internet Archive
- Remember that you can use Control F to search for key terms

Additional questions:
- Was this technology an American invention, or was it imported from Europe?
- Were there parallel experiments in other places in the world in the same period or can Muybridge rightly claim to be the pioneer in cinematography?
Document your findings in your template.

### 1.b Re-use of Muybridge’s material: the father of the *GIF*?
<!-- section-contents -->

Muybridge has been coined as the father of the *GIF*, a very recent development related to digital technology. This comparison points to how existing principles are adapted and re-used in new forms and brings into question whether we can speak about an original work of art or innovation. The same applies of course with regard to historical sources.  

-  Watch this clip created by video activist Kirby Ferguson about how creation is based on the re-use of older material: [Everything is a re-mix](https://vimeo.com/kirbyferguson/remix2015)
- Find out what [the origin of a GIF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GIF) is  
- Below you will find a list of artists/photographers that have been inspired by Muybridge. Open the links to collect information for your table in the template.
- What kind of organisation/artist/scholar re-used aspects of Muybridge’s work/life/art?
- In which context? List the objective, the time frame and the location
- What is the element from Muybridge's work that has been the source of inspiration and has been reused?
