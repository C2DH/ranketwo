Finding content about Muybridge on the web is partly determined by what is indexed by search engines. Which search engine you are used to rely on depends largely on how you have learned to use the web.

You are going to compare results of a search for Muybridge in two search engines: Google and Yahoo

<!-- section-contents -->

- What you can find on the web is also determined by the settings of your search engine. If you change them to another language you might get different results.
- Consult [this instruction](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ViUm0C3Ov1w5ut1O7uY0FoOyaQxw82hvTfkfN3ZfqeA/edit)  on how to change the settings of your search engine
- Try to set the engine to the language that you master best, conduct the same search in Google or Yahoo,
- Are there any search results that you would have missed by only searching in English?
