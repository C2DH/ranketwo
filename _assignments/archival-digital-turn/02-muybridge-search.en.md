Which search engine you are used to rely on, depends largely on how you have learned to use the web.

- What you can find on the web is also determined by the settings of your search engine. If you change them to another language you might get different results.
- Consult [this instruction](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ViUm0C3Ov1w5ut1O7uY0FoOyaQxw82hvTfkfN3ZfqeA/edit)  on how to change the settings of your search engine 
- Try to set the engine to the language that you master best, conduct the same search in Google or Yahoo, 
- Are there any search results that you would have missed by only searching in English?
