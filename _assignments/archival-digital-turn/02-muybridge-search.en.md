Finding content about Eadweard Muybridge on the web is partly determined by what is indexed by search engines. Your choice of search engine depends largely on how you have learned to use the web. This assignment will give you an idea of the possible diversity and ranking of search results. You are going to compare results of a search for Muybridge in two different search engines: Google and Yahoo.

### Instructions
<!-- section-contents -->

First get some insights into how search engines work:
- Watch this lecture by Eli Pariser on [the Filter Bubble](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dua_UvR5mtI){:target="_blank"}: start at 3.55 and continue until 14.36.
- Watch this explanation about [how search engines work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNHR6IQJGZs){:target="_blank"} by Google specialist Matt Cutts, 3.14 mins.

### 2.a Google compared to Yahoo | 30 min
<!-- section-contents -->

- Open two browser windows on your screen, one with Google and one with Yahoo and conduct a search on Eadweard Muybridge in both.
- List the first 8 results using the tables in your answer template.
- Complete the other columns on the basis of the options that are provided in the two boxes: **what type of organisation**, 
  **objective of the organisation**. 
- Bear in mind that most web resources have an “about” or “home” page where you can find details about the organisation and its objectives.

### 2.b Change your settings | 20 min
<!-- section-contents -->

- What you can find on the web is also determined by the settings of your search engine. If you change them to another language you might get different results.
- Consult [these instructions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ViUm0C3Ov1w5ut1O7uY0FoOyaQxw82hvTfkfN3ZfqeA/edit){:target="_blank"} on how to change the settings of your search engine. 
- Try to set the engine to the language that you master best and conduct the same search in Google or Yahoo. 
- Are there any search results that you would have missed by only searching in English?
