Finding content about Muybridge on the web is partly determined by what is indexed by search engines. Depending on how you learned to use the web, you will rely on a particular search engine. This assignment is meant to give you an idea of the diversity and ranking of search results. You are going to compare results of a search for Muybridge in two search engines: Google and Yahoo

First get some insights about how search engines work:
-  Watch this lecture by Eli Pariser on the Filter Bubble: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dua_UvR5mtI

- Consult this instruction on how to change the settings of your search engine (link to google doc document?)
