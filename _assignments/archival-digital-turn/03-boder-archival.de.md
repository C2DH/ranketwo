This assignment is based on the topic of a parallel lesson: from steel wire to website; the interviews of David Boder. It tells the story of how Jewish Latvian American psychologist David Boder pioneered in recording the first accounts of Holocaust survivors. In the summer of 1946 he visited several displacement camps with a wire recorder and collected 121 interviews in 8 different languages.
The focus in this lesson is on the transformation of his collection from interviews fixed on steel wires in 1946, to content that has been made accessible through a publicly accessible website.

### 3.b Restoration or replacement?
<!-- section-contents -->

- Read this [short article by curator Ralph Pugh of the Illinois Institute of Technology](), about the process of publishing the collection online. What does he say about decisions that were taken with regard to the restoration of the sound?
- Listen to the first 5 minutes of [this interview with Janis B.](http://voices.iit.edu/audio.php?doc=bJanis) in the collection of Boder.
* To be able to listen to the interview, you have to open a Chrome Browser. Click on the small icon with, an ‘ i ‘ at the left side of the url,  and allow flash player and pop ups. Keep in mind that you hear Boder's introduction right away, but that the interview takes some time to load.
- What would you have preferred, a better sound so that you may understand what is said, or the original sound with its own atmosphere?
- Does it make sense to create access to spoken content if you don't understand the language or could one limit the information to the translated transcript?
- Document your answer in your template
