Though it is decreasing considerably, sending and receiving letters used to be the standard practice for long distance communication. While it seems to have been tranposed to e-mail correspondance, there are considerable differences. In this assignmen we will consider these differences by discussing Hillary Clinton's publicly accessible e-mails and Margaret Thatcher's digitized correspondance.

### 4.a Comparing e-mails to letters: the creation of a source  
<!-- section-contents -->
What Margaret Thatcher and Hillary Clinton have in common, is that they were politicians, women and operated in a field of international relations. Getting and sending information in an efficient way was crucial to being able to operate strategically. This is why their correspondance is key to writing the history of their era. But the context and options for communication in 1980 were quite different than those in 2008. 
- Have a look at this e-mail exchange between former [US secretary of state Hillary Clinton and Cherie Blair, the wife of former prime minister of the UK Tony Blair](https://wikileaks.org/clinton-emails/emailid/23) that refers to relations in Qatar.
- Compare it with this message written in 1980 by [former prime minister of the UK Margaret Thatcher ](https://c59574e9047e61130f13-3f71d0fe2b653c4f00f32175760e96e7.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/801222%20MT%20to%20Zhaid%20%28529-163%29.pdf) to the crown prince of Qatar

- What is the same and what is different between the messages of Hillary Clinton and Margaret Thatcher ?
- Apply source criticism to both sources, if needed conduct additional web research 
- Complete the table in your temaplate about the differences and similarities between the two sources.

### 4.b Comparing e-mails to letters: the preservation of a source and its digital representation online 
<!-- section-contents -->
A paper letter can be archived in a tangible place, a public or private archive or a library, where it can be consulted while holding it in one's hands. Otherwise, the e-mail is a digital born source, that can be shared with anyone once published online, but needs a hard disk or a server in order to be preserved. 

- Apply source criticism to both sources considering the way they have been preserved and processed in order to be accessible online. 
- Complete the table in your template about the differences and similarities between the two sources.

### 4.c Preservation in the future  
<!-- section-contents -->
- Imagine how the preservation of our e-mail correspondance, or social media exchange, could be preserved in order to be able to write the history of our era in 50 years time. How does the archive of the future look like?
- Write down your answer in 100 words in your template.

### 4.d Intended and unintended audiences
<!-- section-contents -->
Besides addressing an intended audience, letters can also reach an unintended audience. Soldiers during the First World War knew their letters would be read by censors before they were sent out to their families. This prevented them from drawing a realistic picture of the war. Hillary Clinton set up a private email server, perhaps hoping she could discuss matters without the risk of disclosure online. 
Otherwise, the Margaret Thatcher Foundation digitized and published a selection of her private papers to honour her political legacy. 
- Are historians unintended audiences? 
- How long should the distance in time be before privacy no longer plays a role? 
- Do you consider unintended audiences when writing a letter or email?
Answer these questions by going through the literature below, and write a short essay of 500 words.
