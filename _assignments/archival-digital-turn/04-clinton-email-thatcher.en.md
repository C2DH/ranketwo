Though it is decreasing considerably, sending and receiving letters used to be the standard practice for long distance communication. While it seems to have been tranposed to e-mail correspondance, there are considerable differences. In this assignmen we will consider these differences by discussing Hillary Clinton's publicly accessible e-mails and Margaret Thatcher's correspondance.

### 4a. Charateristics

### 4b. Intended and unintended audiences 
<!-- section-contents -->
Apart from the intended audience, letters can have an unintended audience. Soldiers in WW1 knew their letters would be read by censors before the letter would be send to their families, impacting how they wrote about the war. Hillary Clinton set up a private email server, perhaps hoping she could discuss matters without it becoming public knowledge.
