The comparative analysis between paper and digital sources is intended to encourage reflection on the informational and artefactual characteristics of a historical source, its historical context, the selection criteria for archiving and digitization, as well as the transformational chain from one support to the other.

### 4a. Exploring diplomatic documents of the European Union online and in an archive 
<!-- section-contents -->
Explore the WEU-Diplo collection, both at the Archives nationales de Luxembourg (ANLUX) and on the Web. Compare the two sources from the perspective of a historian.
- Consult the WEU-Diplo sub-corpus on the CVCE by Uni.lu Website via this link. The sub-corpus contains 56 documents in XML-TEI format. 
- Answer the following questions by completing your template: 
   - to what collection the sub-corpus belongs?
   - what are the related topic and time frame?
   - what are the  emitting institutions? 
   - is there any copyright information?
   - Pay also attention to elements such as: features of the interface for the visualisation of the transcription and facsimile, search and navigation (see also the contextual Help).
- Create a list of at least 5 documents of your choice from the Web collection.
