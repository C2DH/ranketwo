Newspapers have become an important media since the 19th century and offer valuable information about events and opinions in our past and present societies. Massive digitization of newspapers, which is ongoing in many (national) libraries, holds the promise a bonanza of data for historical research. Yet in the process of creating digital representations of a newspaper and making them retrievable with search terms on the web, certain choices are made, and changes occur with regard to the material and informational value of the sources.  
What you see online is a selection, and its appearance is completely different from what you can hold in your hand in the archive. To understand the difference, you have to apply source criticism to what appears on your screen. This assignment covers two approaches: 1. Considering the choices that are made and the technologies that are used when newspapers are digitized, 2. Considering the diversity of news covergage and the opportunities that online access to machine readable content offers for comparative research.

### Instruction 
Sketch of the type of source: Digitized Newspapers

The need for source criticism of digital content starts even before any technology is applied: one has to ask why a certain corpus has been selected. National Libraries have to deal with all kinds of financial, legal and technical constraints, which together with their own institutional history, determine what is desireable and feasible. One may find a great diversity of newspapers, sometimes unexpected titles or languages in a national library’s collection. For instance, in the Austrian national library, we can find newspapers printed throughout the former Austro-hungarian empire until 1918. In the Polish national library, we find newspapers reflecting the presence of specific cultural communities in the past, written in hebrew, yiddish, russian, and german. 
As digitisation projects are complex, national libraries tend to outsource the work of processing the data, and sometimes this is also the case for the exploitation. In the United Kingdom and France, national libraries engaged in public-private partnerships. In France, the digitised newspapers collections are available via Retronews and Gallica, and for the UK, via a dedicated platform, the British Newspapers Archive. Insight into how the selection and digitization process was led should be part of the information on the resource's website, but not all libraries provide this information. An example of best practices is the Delpher platform for digitized newspapers, created at the Dutch Royal Library, which offers very rich information about the context of the digitisation, and of which the interface is designed in a very user friendly way. The Luxembourg national library gives an historical overview of the project, some technical information on the chosen format, and legal information on copyright issues.

. Source criticism applied to digital newspapers should include these questions:

Selection
- Why was this collection selected for digitization?
- is it complete? Which part of the collection was covered? 
- is it representative?

Transformation from analogue to digital source
- How were the newspaper processed ?
- Have all newspapers titles been processed in the same way? Is the information available at all?
- What is the appearance of the digitised newspaper? Are they in black and white? In color? What color is the paper? 
- Was the digitisation carried out from microfilms or from hard copies? 
- What color makes the reading easier in the digital form?
- What are the differences for newspapers coming from different periods?

Retrieval
- Are the newspapers searchable? 
- Can we apply full text search on their content? 
- What is the quality of the Optical Character Recognition process? 
- Has article segmentation been applied? Can we search within advertisements, images ? 

You are going to find out how this is arranged for a number of collections.

### 6a. Who digitizes, with what purpose and how is access arranged?   
<!-- section-contents -->

- A list of the initiatives across the globe has has been collected on [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:List_of_online_newspaper_archives):
- What projects have been completed or are ongoing in your country? 

- Open up the links to the following collections, browse throught the content, and choose at least two newspapers in a language you feel comfortable with. 

Europeana newspapers (multilingual)
E-Newspapers CH (FR+DE)
Gallica (FR)
Retronews (FR)
ProQuest (EN)
Chronicling America (EN)
Delpher (NL)
ANNO (DE)
Zeitungsportal DDR-Presse (DE)

Complete the table in your template with the answers to the following questions:
- What type of institution carried out the digitisation? public/private, for commercial/academic/preservation purpose?
- How can you access these collections? 
- Is a subscription needed? 
- Is there distant access or is it limited to the premisses of the institution?
- Is there a dedicated interface for the digitised newspapers or is the interface common to other sources, such as books, images?
- Where do the titles come from? 
- In which languages are they available? 
- Are there some special sub-collections? 
- What information is provided on each individual title by the institution?


Selection
- Which titles have been digitised?
Identify the titles that are available at your local library and which one where digitised? (If it is complicated, compare the titles available on ProQuest, Chronicling America to the list of the Library of Congress, see list of links below.)
- Is the information easily available? What is the proportion of digitised vs. non digitised?
- What type of newspapers were digitised first? What type has not been digitised (yet)?

In the following table links are presented to several portanls of digitized newspapers collections. 
Open up each link and document the required fields in the table, with the previous questions in mind. 
- What type of institution carried out the digitisation? public/private, for commercial/academic/preservation purpose?
- How to access these collections? Is a subscription needed?
- Is there a dedicated interface for the digitised newspapers or is the interface common to other sources, such as books, images?
- What is specific to that collection? Where do the titles come from? Which languages are available? Are there some special sub-collections?

### 6b. The newspaper as historical source 
<!-- section-contents -->
Newspapers are published regularly and collected on a daily or weekly basis, representing the events that take place in a society. 
- Collect articles on a particular event and recreate the chronology of that event, using one newspaper title in paper, one in digital form.
For the “hard-copy” search: choose a recent event and go to the library and collect the articles on that event from the available newspapers. (suggestions: an election, a sports event, an art performance such as a concert etc.)
For the digitised version, choose a historical event, such as the Titanic cruise/catastrophe,  the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria, the Woodstock festival of 1969, the Watergate scandal in 1974, John Paul II…)

For each, collect 
- 5 articles published before (anticipation), during (description), after (comments, consequences), 
- For the digital sources: search for 5 articles commemorating this event 10, 20, 100 years after.

- Present the articles in a chronological form.
- What has changed in the perception of the event/actors/situation?
- Write a short essay of about 500 words on your findings
