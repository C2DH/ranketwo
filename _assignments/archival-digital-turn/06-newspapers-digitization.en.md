Massive digitization of newspapers is ongoing in many
libraries to offer online access to the public in general and
to researchers in particular. For the last group it is important 
to reflect on the politics and transformative impact
of the digitization process. What you see online is not the
same as what you can hold in your hand in the archive. 
This assignment covers two approaches: 1. Considering the choices that are
made when newspapers are digitized, 2. Considering the diversity of news 
covergage by making use of the affordances of massive
online access to newspapers.

    6a. What changes with the digitisation?
    <!-- section-contents -->
    
Digitisation is usually carried out by (national) libraries, fuelled by the legal deposit existing in many countries.
The collections of the national libraries are gradually digitised, and are the result of their paper collections, and the priorities set by the institutions. For instance, in the Austrian national library, we can find newspapers printed in all the former Austro-hungarian empire until 1918, in the Polish national library, we can see newspapers printed in hebrew, written in yiddish, mainly before 1939, or written in Russian, printed in cyrillic before 1918 and in the German collection, we can find newspapers printed by the German communities abroad, notably in Eastern Europe. 
Questions that related to source criticism applied to digital newspapers are: 

Selection
- Which titles have been digitised?
Identify the titles that are available at your local library and which one where digitised? (If it is complicated, compare the titles available on ProQuest, Chronicling America to the list of the Library of Congress, see list of links below.)
- Is the information easily available? What is the proportion of digitised vs. non digitised?
- What type of newspapers were digitised first? What type has not been digitised (yet)?

Transformation
- How were the newspaper processed ?
- How big is the coverage of that processing?
- Are all newspapers titles processed in the same way? Is the information available at all?
- How do the digitised newspaper look like? 
- Are they in black and white? In color? What color is the paper? 
- Was the digitisation carried out from microfilms or hard copies? 
- What color makes the reading easier in the digital form?
- What are the differences for the newspapers coming from different periods?

Retrieval
- Are the newspapers searchable? 
- Can we apply full text search on their content? (Is there OCR?)
- Is there article segmentation? Can we search within advertisements, images ? 
- Are they other types of segments?(Is there OLR?)
 
In the following table links are presented to several portanls of digitized newspapers collections. 
Open up each link and document the required fields in the table, with the previous questions in mind. 
- What type of institution carried out the digitisation? public/private, for commercial/academic/preservation purpose?
- How to access these collections? Is a subscription needed?
- Is there a dedicated interface for the digitised newspapers or is the interface common to other sources, such as books, images?
- What is specific to that collection? Where do the titles come from? Which languages are available? Are there some special sub-collections?

    6b.The newspapers as historical sources 
    <!-- section-contents -->
Newspapers are published regularly and collected on a daily or weekly basis, representing the events that take place in a society. 
- Collect articles on a particular event and recreate the chronology of that event, using one newspaper title in paper, one in digital form.
For the “hard-copy” search: choose a recent event and go to the library and collect the articles on that event from the available newspapers. (suggestions: an election, a sports event, an art performance such as a concert etc.)
For the digitised version, choose a historical event, such as the Titanic cruise/catastrophe,  the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria, the Woodstock festival of 1969, the Watergate scandal in 1974, John Paul II…)

For each, collect 
- 5 articles published before (anticipation), during (description), after (comments, consequences), 
- For the digital sources: search for 5 articles commemorating this event 10, 20, 100 years after.

- Present the articles in a chronological form.
- What has changed in the perception of the event/actors/situation?
- Write a short essay of about 500 words on your findings
