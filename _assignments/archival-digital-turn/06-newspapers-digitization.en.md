Newspapers have become an important media since the 19th century and offer valuable information about events and opinions in our past and present societies. Massive digitization of newspapers, which is ongoing in many (national) libraries, holds the promise a bonanza of data for historical research. Yet, in the process of creating online access to digital representations of a newspaper, certain choices are made, and some changes occur that historians need to understand. What you retrieve online is a selection of what archives contain. 
National Libraries have to deal with all kinds of financial, legal and technical constraints, which together with their own institutional history, determine their policy. This complexity has led many archives to outsource the work of processing and exploiting the data through public-private partnerships with companies. Moreover, the materiality and appearance of what appears on your screen, is quite different from what you can hold in your hand in the archive. To understand the difference, you have to critically assess how the source was handeled to turn into a machine readable language. This assignment covers two approaches: 1. You are asked to consider the choices made and technologies used for the digitization and online publication of various newspapers, 2. You will explore the diversity of news covergage and exploit the opportunities of online access to newspapers by conducting comparative research.

### Instruction 

<!-- section-contents -->
To sensitize you to the subject of digitization of newspapers, watch these clips on two large scale digitization projects, one in the Unites States that discusses all the aspects of the goal of the project and the digitization process: [Chronincling America](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LclIm9s7Iho), and one in Europe, [Europeana Newspapers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5G6v00Z8CyQ) that is meant for promotion of the project. Also watch the [clip about retired engineer Tom Tryniski](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KVWDX6oaYCg&feature=youtu.be), who took up the task of digitizing a gigantic corpus of newspapers and offering them online free of charge. 

Then go through the key questions that should be asked when applying source criticism to digitized newspapers: 

Selection

- Why was this collection selected for digitization?
- is it complete? Which part of the collection is covered? 
- is it representative?

Transformation from analogue to digital source

- How were the newspaper processed? Have all newspapers titles been processed in the same way?
- What is the appearance of the original newspaper? Are they in black and white or in color? What is the color of the paper? Is this visible on your screen? 
- Was the digitisation carried out from microfilms or from hard copies? 
- What color makes the reading easier in the digital form?
- How does digitization handle differences between newspapers coming from different periods?

Retrieval

- Are the newspapers searchable? Can we apply full text search on their content? 
- What is the quality of the Optical Character Recognition process? 
- Has article segmentation been applied? Can we search within advertisements, images ?

### 6.a Who digitizes, with what purpose and how is access arranged?   
<!-- section-contents -->
You are going to find out how this is arranged for a number of collections. 

- A list of initiatives across the globe has been collected on [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:List_of_online_newspaper_archives):
- What projects have been completed or are ongoing in your own country? 

- Open up the links to the following collections, browse throught the content, and choose at least two newspapers in a language you feel comfortable with. 

[Europeana newspapers](http://www.europeana-newspapers.eu) (multilingual)  
[E-Newspapers CH](http://www.onlinenewspapers.com/switzerl.htm) (FR+DE)  
[Gallica](https://gallica.bnf.fr/html/und/presse-et-revues/presse-et-revues)(FR)  
[Retronews](https://www.retronews.fr)(FR)  
[ProQuest](https://www.proquest.com/products-services/pq-hist-news.html)(EN)  
[Chronicling America](https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov)(EN)

[ANNO](http://anno.onb.ac.at/anno-suche#searchMode=simple&from=1)(DE)  
[Zeitungsportal DDR-Presse](http://zefys.staatsbibliothek-berlin.de/ddr-presse/) (DE) 

Complete the table in your template with the answers to the following questions:
- What type of institution carried out the digitisation? public/private, for commercial/academic/preservation purpose?
- How can you access these collections? 
- Is a subscription needed? 
- Is there distant access or is it limited to the premisses of the institution?
- Is there a dedicated interface for the digitised newspapers or is the interface common to other sources, such as books and images?
- Where do the titles come from? 
- In which languages are they available? 
- Are there some special sub-collections? 
- What information is provided on each individual title by the institution?

| | 1. Institution | 2. Type of access | 3. Interface | 4. Collection specificities

Selection
- Which titles have been digitised?
Identify the titles that are available at your local library and which one where digitised? 
- If this is not feasible, compare the titles available on ProQuest, Chronicling America to the list of the Library of Congress, see list of links below.
- Is the information easily available? What is the proportion of digitised vs. non digitised?
- What type of newspapers were digitised first? What type has not been digitised (yet)?

### 6.b The newspaper as historical source 
<!-- section-contents -->

Newspapers are published regularly and collected on a daily or weekly basis, representing events that take place in society. One may find a great diversity of newspapers, with sometimes unexpected titles or languages in a national library’s collection. For instance, in the Austrian national library, we can find newspapers printed throughout the former Austro-hungarian empire until 1918. In the Polish national library, we find newspapers reflecting the presence of specific cultural communities in the past, written in hebrew, yiddish, russian, and german. This item in the [news website gizmodo about newspapers with an old tradition](https://io9.gizmodo.com/the-worlds-oldest-newspapers-still-being-published-tod-1369904730) illustrates the continuity of some newspapers. It is striking to see the difference in appearance. Reading the newspaper is also a practice that contributes to a sense of national identity. You will be comparing paper to digital newspapers and the representation of events over time. 

- Collect articles on two particular events and recreate the chronology of these events, using one newspaper title in paper of a recent event,  and one in digital form of the past . 

For the “hard-copy” search: go to the library and collect articles on that event from the available newspapers  (suggestions: an election, a sports event, an art performance such as a concert etc.)

For the digitised version, choose a historical event, such as the Titanic cruise/catastrophe, the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria, the Woodstock festival of 1969, the Watergate scandal in 1974, John Paul II…)

For each, collect 
- 5 articles published before (anticipation), during (description), after (comments, consequences), 
- For the digital sources: search for 5 articles commemorating this event 10, 20, 100 years after.

- Create a list of the articles in a chronological form.

- Write a short essay of about 500 words on your findings, based on the answers to these questions:
- What has changed in the perception of the event/actors/situation? (short term, long term) 
- What are the main differences between collecting articles from paper newspapers and digitised newspapers? (sitting behind your screen, going to the archive/library)


### 6.c The newspaper and the website as sources of knowledge 
Depeding on your age and education, you will be accustomed to specific kinds of news, either television, radio, newspapers, news feeds through your mobile phone, or websites that publish news. This assignment asks you to reflect on the sources of your knowledge on current cultural, economical and political developments. 
- Choose a current topic or event and compare how it is represented in a paper newspaper, a news website, a newsreel on the radio and on the television. 
- Complete the table in your template on the basis of these key questions:
- Why have you chosen these particular news sources? 
- Do you trust these sources? 
- What is your trust based on?
