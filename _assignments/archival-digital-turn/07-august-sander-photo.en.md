This assignment deals with the portrait-collection of the famous German photographer August Sander (1876-1964), People of the 20th Century. Sander’s aim was to document the entire society of his time as he perceived it. He believed that it would reveal a universal truth about societal traits by means of his photo camera. In the last decades many of his pictures can be found on the web. But when applying source criticism to Sander’s work as it can be retrieved through the web, it is crucial to know what the object of the criticism is: The original pictures taken by Sander? The printed books? Or the digital versions of Sander’s portraits that can be found on the web? The various perspectives will be considered. In the first part of the assignment,  digital representations of Sander’s work online  will be discussed concerning the intentions behind publishing the images online and the functionality of search engines. The second part will bring you back to the origin of the source: the images that were shot at the time, and the artists intentions, and the first publishers and curators of his work.  

<!--
August Sander  (1876-1964). Maybe because of that he set himself the task to create a portrait of the whole(!) society as it appeared to him with the means of his photo camera. His goal was to take pictures of typical representatives of all social and occupational groups in society. He wanted those pictures to be universal although of course he only took pictures of people in his surroundings and of those he ncountered during his trips.
You have to bear in mind: Sander chose the people he took pictures of as representative for a whole social group.
He sorted his photographs in folders and categorised them in seven groups:
The Farmer (Der Bauer)
The Skilled Tradesman (Der Handwerker)
The Woman (Die Frau)
Classes and Professions (Die Stände)
The Artists (Die Künstler)
The City (Die Großstadt)
The Last People (Die letzten Menschen)
