This assignment deals with the portrait collection by the famous German photographer August Sander (1876-1964), “People of the 20th Century”. Sander’s aim was to document the entire society of his time as he perceived it. He believed that his camera would reveal universal truths about societal traits. In recent decades, many of his pictures have become accessible to the general public through the web. But when using this digitised and published material as a source of knowledge about his work, it is necessary to apply source criticism and trace the origin of what can be viewed on anyone’s computer screen. What can we consider as the original work by Sander? His glass plates? Prints made from his glass plates? The printed books about his work that made him famous long after his death, or the digital versions of Sander’s portraits that can be found on the web? The following perspectives will be considered: first you will explore the question of why Sander’s digital representations of his photos have been published online, and how they can be retrieved through search engines. The second part of the assignment brings you back to the origin of the source: the images that were shot by him at the time, his motives, and how the first publishers and curators appreciated his work.  

The idea for Sander’s project “People of the 20th Century” first came about in 1925. It covers the period of the Weimar Republic (1919-1933). During his lifetime Sander published excerpts of his work and curated smaller exhibitions, but unfortunately he never managed to finalise the collection that had been originally designed to comprise 45 portfolios. When he passed away in 1964, his son Günther Sander inherited approximately 2,000 negatives and managed to publish some of these in the photo book *Menschen ohne Maske* in 1971. Another edition was published in 2001 by the August Sander Foundation, SK Stiftung Kultur, in Cologne. In 2010 the foundation launched a [website dedicated to Sander](http://augustsander.org/md20jh/){:target="_blank"}. But the dissemination of his work was not completely in their hands.  

In 2003, an early version of the foundation’s website was snapshotted by the Internet Archive. Around 2008 one of the first online photographs of August Sander appeared on the website of the Northern Gallery for Contemporary Art in Sunderland (UK), to mark the exhibition “Fragile Democracy: new international photography”. The same year the internet art forum Luminous-Lint was launched with pictures of August Sander on its website. The first YouTube clip appeared in 2010, at the same time as the launch of the search tool Pinterest and the introduction of Google’s image search algorithms, which proved very successful. All these developments influenced the dissemination and reinterpretation of Sander's work.

### Instructions
<!-- section-contents -->

You are going to compare search results of a query in two different web resources: Google Images and Pinterest.   
Before starting your web search, you can improve your search skills by exploring the following documents/clips: 
- [Here](https://youtu.be/BNHR6IQJGZs){:target="_blank"} is a clip about how Google’s search engine works as explained by Matt Cutts.

What has to be taken into account when watching this accessible and clear tutorial is that it is produced by Google, which is a commercial company. Its dominant role is called into question by people who are concerned with the concentration of power and how it can be misused to the disadvantage of smaller competitors. If you are interested you can listen to a [newsreel about applying antitrust law against Google in the US](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2018-05-22/google-s-illegal-search-gets-prime-time-tv-treatment-video){:target="_blank"}.

- [Here](https://youtu.be/oJzD4vF5dFA){:target="_blank"} is a short explanation on how Google Images works. 
- [Here](https://youtu.be/oJzD4vF5dFA){:target="_blank"} is a clip explaining how the social medium Pinterest works.  
- [Here](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/find-date-published-post-insanely-simple-tips/){:target="_blank"} is an explanation on how to track down details on when online content was published.   

Not every publication date can be traced through a link. If you want to avoid the frustrating experience of trial and error, first take a look at this PDF [cit](what-works-and-what-doesn't), in which the tips explained above have successfully been applied to a photo from Sander’s collection.

### 7.a Access to August Sander's portraits through Google and Pinterest
<!-- section-contents -->

- First perform a Google Images search with the name **August Sander**.
- Then open a new tab and do the same with the social media website Pinterest.
- Compare the two tabs. Note down the differences in your template. Consider the following elements:
  - The key words at the top of the page metadata/tags
  - The standard for the size of the photos
  - The metadata of each photo that is visible on the web page
- Now choose 2 photos that appear in both web pages, and note down the metadata of the photo that appears when you click on it:
  - Look for a reference to the origin of the photo in its analogue form.
  - Try to find out when the photo was published online.
  - Check whether it really is a photo by August Sander.

### 7.b Associative tagging
<!-- section-contents -->

- Meet up with a fellow student; both of you should bring your own laptop.
- Compare the images that appear on the Pinterest web page on your own screen. The results may differ if your search history and geolocation is different. Google keeps track of these elements to deliver the best customised search results.  
- If you want to know which factors determine the differences in search results, see this blog from [online marketing company LCN](https://www.lcn.com/blog/get-different-results-google-vs-location-users/){:target="_blank"}.
- Now, without clicking on the individual pictures in the results page, either those from Google or Pinterest, together choose 6 portraits (groups, individuals, old, young, women, men).
- Both of you should create space in your answering template, create screenshots of these 6 portraits and paste them into the template.
- Make sure to leave some space for a text box below each portrait. If you don’t know how to make a screenshot, consult this web page for [Microsoft](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/13776/windows-use-snipping-tool-to-capture-screenshots){:target="_blank"} or this webpage for [Mac](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201361#earlier){:target="_blank"}.
- Start by working individually. Take a long look at the portraits on your own laptop, and give each portrait an associative tag, the first word that comes to mind.
- Then try to imagine the age and profession of the person/people in the portraits and the social class they belong to. Add this to the text box in the template. 
- When you have finished, compare your results with your fellow student.
- Can you explain the differences? Discuss why you have labelled the pictures in that particular way.
- Now click on the pictures and try to find out what the original descriptions of the portraits are. Add them to the text boxes in your template.
- You may encounter difficulties in tracing the original metadata. These are the possible results of your search:  
  - You are led to a website with original information on the photo, its origin, what it depicts, and why and when it was published online.
  - You are led to a website that does not reveal information about the specific photo but generic information about a book in which the photo features.
  - You are led to a website in which the photo has been reused without information about what is depicted, when and how it was created, and when and why it was reused and published online. This is called “decontextualisation”; in other words the digital object is detached from its original context of creation and archival history. If you had created a PDF of your assignment and published it online without references to the original work, you would also be contributing to the decontextualisation of Sander’s work. To keep these processes under control, it is important to reference correctly.
