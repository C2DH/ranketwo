This assignment deals with the portrait-collection of the famous German photographer August Sander (1876-1964), People of the 20th Century. Sander’s aim was to document the entire society of his time as he perceived it. He believed that it would reveal a universal truth about societal traits by means of his photo camera. In the last decades many of his pictures have become accessible to the general audience through the web. When using this digitized and published material as source of knowledge on his work, it is however necessary to apply source criticism and trace the origin of what can be viewed on anyone's computer screen. What can we consider as the original work by Sander? His glassplates? Prints made from his glassplates? The printed books about his work that made him famous long after his death, or the digital versions of Sander’s portraits that can be found on the web? The following perspectives will be considered: first you will deal with the questions on why Sander' digital representations of his photos have been published online, and how they can be retreived through search engines. The second part of the assignment brings you back to the origin of the source: the images that were shot by him at the time, his motives, and how the first publishers and curators appreciated his work.

### Instruction 
<!-- section-contents -->

The idea for his project “People of the 20th Century” was born in 1925 and covers the period of the Weimar Republic 1919-1933. 
During his life-time Sander published excerpts of his work and curated smaller exhibitions, but unfortunately never managed to finalise the collection that had been originally designed to comprise 45 portfolia. When he passed away in 1964, his son Günther Sander inherited  ca. 2,000 negatives and managed to publish part of these in the photo book Menschen ohne Maske in 1971. Another edition had been published in 2001 the August Sander Foundation, SK Stiftung Kultur, in Cologne published a next edition. Later in 2010 they launched a website dedicated to Sander http://augustsander.org/md20jh/. But the dissemination of his work was not completely in their hands.  
As early as 2003 an early version of the foundation's website could be snapshotted by the Internet Archive. Around 2008 one of the first online photographs of August Sander appeared on the website of the Northern gallery of Contemporary Art in Sunderland (UK),in the context of the exhibition ‘Fragile Democracy:new international photography'. In the same year the internet art-forum Luminous-Lint was launched with pictures of August Sander on its website. The first youtube clip appeared in 2010, in the same period as the launch of the search tool Pinterest and the introduction of Google's image search algorithms which proved very succesful. All these developments influenced the dissemination and re-interpretation of Sander's work.

### 7b. Comparing Associative Tagging 
<!-- section-contents -->
- Now, without clicking on the individual pictures in the results page, either those from Google or from Pinterest, choose 5 portraits (groups, individuals, old, young, women, men) 
- Take a long look at them and give each a tag or name that comes to your mind. Document this in your template.
- Meet up with a fellow student, compare your search results, your choices, and your tags.  
- Complement each others tags with an additional assessment of the background of the people portrayed on the photo
  - social class
  - profession
  - age
- Which criteria did you use for labelling the photographs? Why did you label the pictures in this way? Discuss!
- Take a look at Sander's folders, in which folder would Sander have put the photographs you chose?
- Now click on the pictures, you will see how Sander labelled the pictures himself.
- What does this tell you about your own perceptions and labels?
- What does it tell you about August Sander’s view on society?
