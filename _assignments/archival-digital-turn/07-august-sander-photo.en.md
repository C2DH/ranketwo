August Sander: Menschen des 20. Jahrhunderts/ People of the 20th Century

The famous German photographer, August Sander, originating from Cologne experienced great societal upheavals in his lifetime (1876-1964). Maybe because of that he set himself the task to create a portrait of the whole(!) society as it appeared to him with the means of his photo camera. His goal was to take pictures of typical representatives of all social and occupational groups in society. He wanted those pictures to be universal although of course he only took pictures of people in his surroundings and of those he had encountered on his trips.You have to bear in mind: Sander chose the people he took pictures of as representative for a whole social group. 
He sorted his photographs in folders and categorised them in seven groups:
The Farmer (Der Bauer)
The Skilled Tradesman (Der Handwerker)
The Woman (Die Frau)
Classes and Professions (Die Stände)
The Artists (Die Künstler)
The City (Die Großstadt)
The Last People (Die letzten Menschen)
