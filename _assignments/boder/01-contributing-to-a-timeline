***The rationale of this assignment*** 

In the animation you watched the focus is mostly on the creation and  transformation  of David Boder’s collection from 
analogue source to online web resource. But the historical context also deserves some attention. Boder’s expertise and mindset
were also the result of what he encountered during his life in terms of personal drawbacks, technological innovation, scientific
progress and political conflict. This assignment introduces you to a digital tool with which you can create a timeline  that can 
be populated and shared. The purpose is to make you aware of the historical context in which Boder’s  historical sources were created.  
You will be  conducting critical web research and will be contributing to a digital timeline.

This is the basis to complete the  assignments below


1a      ***Create an entry in one of the dates in the timeline***

-      The chronological sequence of dates needs to be complemented with information. 

Choose two dates to create an entry. 
For background information on possible entries, go to the box ‘links’, the last section of Boder’s biography, and consult the website 
Voices of the Holocaust and the clip 5 min History. 
Open your template and go to the table for assignment 1a 
Write 2 entries of max 100 words 
Look for an appropriate image on the web and add copy the links to these images in the same table 
Now cut and paste the entries and the links to the photos and place  them in the timeline, following the instructions in the provided tutorial
Remember to save your entries!!!



1b      ***Create two new entries with text and images in the timeline*** 
             
These can be subjects related to Boder’s life, such as:
When and  where did Boder study?
When was the wire recorder invented?
When were the American Newsreels about the camps shown to the American audience?


1c      ***Create a new account and a new timeline***   
                        
Follow the instructions that are supplied in the Tutorial
Put together at least 4 entries on a timeline about a topic  that is related either to Boder’s course of life, or to other early accounts on 
experiences in concentration camps.  You could consider: 

Politics and societal developments:    Think of the political situation of the countries in which Bode lived or travelled to: Latvia, Russia, Siberia, Japan, Mexico, United States, Europe. 

Technology :     Think of  inventions with regard to recording or communication technology. 

The History of Psychology :  Think of the developments in this science and the creation of the American National Mental Health Institution.

The history of  interview collections:  Who introduced creating collections of recordings of people’s experiences ? 

A chronological list of audio and film recordings with testimonies of experiences in concentration camps: Think of war trials, television, radio, the web

Remember to first document your research in your template,
and then    paste it into the online timeline. This way you will 
always have the basis of your content on your own computer as
a backup. 


1d    ***Copyright Law and the web*** 

For assignment 1b and 1c  you have to take into account the legal 
principles that exist with regard to the reuse of images on the web.
Infringement of copyright can lead to high fines. The best way to
protect yourself is to either use copyright free material, or to make sure
the web-environment is not public, by working in a password protected 
environment.
Check which of the images that you have used for your timeline are
open source and which ones can used w only be used with permission.
Where can you find this information if you search on the web?

Write a short abstract in your template of 150 words on what you have found on the web, and what you can do with it.
