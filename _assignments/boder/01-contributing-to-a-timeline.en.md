In the animation you watched the focus is mostly on the creation and  transformation  of David Boder’s collection from
analogue source to online web resource. But the historical context also deserves some attention. Boder’s expertise and mindset
were also the result of what he encountered during his life in terms of personal drawbacks, technological innovation, scientific
progress and political conflict. This assignment introduces you to a digital tool with which you can create a timeline  that can
be populated and shared. The purpose is to make you aware of the historical context in which Boder’s  historical sources were created.
You will be  conducting critical web research and will be contributing to a digital timeline.

## d Copyright Law and the web

For assignment 1b and 1c  you have to take into account the legal
principles that exist with regard to the reuse of images on the web.
Infringement of copyright can lead to high fines. The best way to
protect yourself is to either use copyright free material, or to make sure
the web-environment is not public, by working in a password protected
environment.
Check which of the images that you have used for your timeline are
open source and which ones can used w only be used with permission.
Where can you find this information if you search on the web?

Write a short abstract in your template of 150 words on what you have found on the web, and what you can do with it.
