briefing lecturer


One might wonder why students of a humanities discipline
should learn about the obsolete technology of the wire recorder.
The reason is that practising digital source criticism is more than reflecting
on the informational value of a historical source.
It also means considering the transmitter of information and its material qualities.
Considering the pervasiveness of digital information technology
in our everyday life, it is important to understand the underlying
physical phenomena and to be able to reflect on how the shift
from analogue to digital affected our use of technology.
