title:  The analogue wire recorder compared to digital audio recording

One might wonder why students of a humanities discipline
should learn about the obsolete technology of the wire recorder.
The reason is to understand the difference between the physics
of capturing sound in the analogue era and how this relates to
the physics of digital technology. Practising digital source
criticism is  more than  reflecting on the informational value of a
historical source. It also means considering the transmitter of
information and its material qualities.
Considering  the pervasiveness of digital information technology
in our everyday life it is  important to understand the underlying
physical phenomena and to be able to reflect on how the shift
from analogue to digital affected our use of technology.
