When reflecting on the value and meaning of a source that has been published on the web, it is important to take the context of its creation into consideration. Turning everything into searchable digital data raises the risk of disregarding the different methods and approaches used by researchers when they created the data. This assignment is designed to highlight the differences between the accounts of Holocaust survivors that were summarised in written reports and those recorded on a device by Boder. They are both accessible online, but what is the difference? What can you do with this material that was not possible when it was kept in an archive? For this assignment, we invite you to work with the following websites: 
- DEGOB - National Committee for Attending Deportees. Recollections of the Holocaust - The world's most extensive testimonial site [http://degob.org/index.php](http://degob.org/index.php). This is a collection of testimonies collected by the Hungarian National Commission for Deportees.
- Voices of the Holocaust [https://voices.library.iit.edu/](https://voices.library.iit.edu/)

<!-- section-contents -->

- Go to the website with the collection of protocols collected by the [Hungarian National Commission for Deportees](http://degob.org/){:target="_blank"}. 
- Search with the keyword “**help**” to get an idea of how to search in interview summaries.
- If you go through the first five hits by using Ctrl + F, you can trace how the term “help” has different positive and negative meanings in the reports.
- Try to do the same with [Voices of the Holocaust](https://voices.library.iit.edu/){:target="_blank"}.
 A list of interviews will appear with metadata and the amount of hits in the transcript. Exlore the search results by clicking the "Explore the archive" button. 
- What strikes you when assessing the search results?
- Note the answers in your template.

### 2.c  A second exploration of the archives: how key characters are represented | 15 min
<!-- section-contents -->

- Compare how a respondent describes the selection process for the gas chambers and the role of SS physician Mengele in [protocol](http://degob.org/index.php?showjk=131){:target="_blank"} with how this is done in [Boder’s interview with Jola Gross](https://iit.aviaryplatform.com/r/2804x54p2z){:target="_blank"}.
- What strikes you as different between the summarised interview and the literal transcript of the interview?
- Note the answer in your template.

<!-- section -->

### 2.d  A third exploration of the archives: the identity of the speaker | 15 min
<!-- section-contents -->

- Compare the protocol of a 15-year-old girl in [http://degob.org/](http://degob.org/){:target="_blank"} (select Female and date of birth 1931 in the advanced search environment) with listening to [Boder’s interview with 15-year-old Edith Zierer](https://iit.aviaryplatform.com/r/0g3gx44z67){:target="_blank"}<sup>*</sup>.
- What strikes you as different when comparing the two sources?
- Note your findings in your template.

Bear in mind that the interview takes a long time to load, and that it is conducted in German, interspersed with comments by Boder in English. If you don't master German, you can read the English translation of the transcript.
