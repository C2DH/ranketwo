When reflecting on the value and meaning of a source that has been published on the web, it is important to take the context of its creation into consideration. Turning everything into searchable digital data raises the risk of disregarding the different methods and approaches used by researchers when they created the data. This assignment is designed to highlight the differences between the accounts of Holocaust survivors that were summarised in written reports and those recorded on a device by Boder. They are both accessible online, but what is the difference? What can you do with this material that was not possible when it was kept in an archive?
