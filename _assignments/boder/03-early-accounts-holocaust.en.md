When reflecting on the value and meaning of a source that has
been published on the web it is important to take the context of
its creation into consideration.

Turning everything into searchable digital data, creates the risk of disregarding the
different methods and approaches that researchers used
at the time when they created the data.

> This assignment is
meant to give an impression of the differences between
the accounts of Holocaust survivors that were summarized in
written reports, and those recorded on a device by Boder.
They are both accessible online, but what is the difference?
What can you do with this material that was not possible whe
it was kept in the archive

### 3a Source Criticism
<!-- section-contents -->
Go to the Tab  On DEGOB and click on The Protocols. Read the text on the methodology that was applied.
Go to the website Voices of the Holocaust, and open the Tab About the Project, read the first three sub tabs: David Boder, Voices Project, Project Notes.
Apply source criticism to both the Hungarian testimonies and Boder’s interviews by completing the table in your template

<!--section -->
### 3b  A first exploration of the archives: how verbs are used
<!-- section-contents -->
Go to the website with the collection of protocols collected by the Hungarian National Commission for  Deportees http://degob.org/.
Search with the key word ‘help’ to get an idea of how search in
interview summaries works.
If you go through the first 5 hits by using  `Control F`, you can trace how the term ‘help’ has different positive and negative meanings in the reports.
Try to do the same with http://voices.iit.edu/voices_project
What strikes you when assessing the search results?
Document the answers in your template

<!--section -->
### 3c A second exploration of the archives: how key characters are  represented
<!-- section-contents -->
Compare how a respondent describes the selection
process for the gas  chambers and the role of
SS-physician  Mengele, in protocol http://degob.org/index.php?showjk=131  with
how this is done in Boder’s interview with Jola Gross.

- What strikes you as different between the summarized interview and  the literal transcript of the interview?
- Document the answer in your template

<!--section -->
### 3d     A third exploration of the archives: the identity of the speaker
<!-- section-contents -->
Compare the protocol of a 15 year old girl in  http://degob.org/
(select Female and date of birth 1931 in the search environment) with listening to the interview of Boder with 15 year old Edith Zierer.

- What strikes you as different when comparing the two sources?
- Document your findings in your template

              * If you want to listen to Edith Zierer, you have to open a
               Chrome Browser. Click on the small icon with an ‘ i ‘  and
               allow  flash player and pop ups. Keep in mind that the
               interview takes a long time to load, so you might carry on
               with another assignment in the meantime.
