In the animation about Boder, photographs of victims and of
families have been used without clarifying their identity. This is
done to create an association. The photo stands for a group or
for a societal-cultural context. In a sense the same effect is
created as Boder observed while watching the newsreels about
the liberated concentration camps: people are portrayed
as an anonymous group of persons, disregarding their
individuality.
Because this lesson is about source criticism, we have tried to
trace the context in which these photos were made and the
names of the people who are portrayed. The assignment invites
students to search for the context in which these photos were
made and how they ended up in this animation.
