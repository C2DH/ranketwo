Boder’s approach shifted from that of a classical social scientist looking for evidence, to that of an ethnographer documenting people’s expressions. The footage shown in this box was shot in Henonville, but it only shows moving images of people without sound. The sound is stored on a separate medium. This assignment is meant to make students aware of the multimodal dimension of a source, and how the web facilitates access to the different modalities. You will be asked to reflect on the context of creation, the context of preservation and the context of digitization of the material.
