# The vvvv rationale of this assignment:

Boder’s approach shifted from that of a classical social scientist looking for evidence,
to that of an ethnographer documenting people’s expressions.
The footage shown in this box was shot in Henonville, but it only shows moving images of people.
In order to handle songs as historical sources , you need more information. 
This assignment is meant to make students aware of the multimodal dimension of a source, and how the web 
facilitates access to the different modalities and how copies of the material are created 
so that it can be shown in different environments.
