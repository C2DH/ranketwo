title: Where did Boder conduct his interviews?
order: 7

---

As is described in the clip, Boder conducted his interviews in
difficult circumstances. It was hard for him to find a quiet place
where he could be alone with his interviewees. This affected
the quality of his recordings, and  probably also the length of
the interviews. To give you an idea of these  circumstances you
can watch a video created by Yad Vashem on the situation in
Displacement Camps.
This assignment is meant to make you reflect on the
Displacement Camps as the first places of ‘knowledge
production’ about the Holocaust.
