As described in the clip, Boder conducted his interviews in difficult circumstances. It was hard for him to find a quiet place where he could be alone with his interviewees. This affected the quality of his recordings, and probably also the length of the interviews. To give you an idea of these circumstances you can watch a video created by Yad Vashem on the situation in displacement camps.  
This assignment is designed to help you reflect on displacement camps as the first places of “knowledge production” about the Holocaust.

The mindsets of the survivors housed in displacement camps were clearly geared towards the future. But there is one reference to commemoration projects.
- Stop the clip when the poster is shown and take a print screen.
- As the text is in Hebrew, you are going to use Google’s image recognition technology to find more information about the poster. 
- Go to Google Images, click on the icon of the camera in the search bar, choose “upload” and upload the print screen of the poster.
- You will find references to a collection of Jewish posters. 
- Write a short abstract of max. 150 words about this collection, based on applying source criticism to its website:
  - Who created the organisation?
  - Who created the website? 
  - When did this happen? 
  - What financial resources were used?
  - what was the purpose?
