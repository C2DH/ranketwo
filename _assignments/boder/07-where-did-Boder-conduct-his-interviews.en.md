title: Where did Boder conduct his interviews?
order: 7
---

As is described in the clip, Boder conducted his interviews in difficult circumstances.
It was hard for him to find a quiet place where he could be alone with his interviewees.
This affected the quality of his recordings, and probably also the length of the interviews.
To give you an idea of these circumstances you can watch a video created by Yad Vashem on the situation in Displacement Camps.
This assignment is meant to give you an idea of how circumstances affected both the discourse of the interviewees and the approach
of the interviewer.
