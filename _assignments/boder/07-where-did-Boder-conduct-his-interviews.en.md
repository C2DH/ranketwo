As described in the clip, Boder conducted his interviews in difficult circumstances. It was hard for him to find a quiet place where he could be alone with his interviewees. This affected the quality of his recordings, and probably also the length of the interviews. To give you an idea of these circumstances you can watch a video created by Yad Vashem on the situation in displacement camps. 
This assignment is designed to help you reflect on displacement camps as the first places of “knowledge production” about the Holocaust.
