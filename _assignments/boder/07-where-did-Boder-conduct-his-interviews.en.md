As described in the clip, Boder conducted his interviews in difficult circumstances. It was hard for him to find a quiet place where he could be alone with his interviewees. This affected the quality of his recordings, and probably also the length of the interviews. To give you an idea of these circumstances you can watch a video created by Yad Vashem on the situation in displacement camps.
This assignment is designed to help you reflect on displacement camps as the first places of “knowledge production” about the Holocaust.

### 7.a  Envisioning a future life | 15 min
<!-- section-contents -->

The mindsets of the survivors housed in displacement camps were clearly geared towards the future. There are however also references to commemoration projects. One of them is a poster commissioned by the "Central Historical Commission at the Central Committee of Liberated Jews in the American Zone of Occupation in Germany"
- Stop the clip when the poster is shown and take a print screen.
- As the text is in Hebrew, if you don't master the language, you can use Google’s image recognition technology to find more information about the poster.
- Go to Google Images, click on the icon of the camera in the search bar, choose “upload” and upload the print screen of the poster.
- If the link is still working you can find [information about the poster here.](https://il.bidspirit.com/ui/lotPage/source/catalog/auction/6955/lot/126311/Two-Posters-Issued-by-the-Central?lang=zh){:target="_blank"}
In the left corner, you will see the icon of a second poster.
- If the link is broken, open this screencast of the [webresource](../../assets/videos/screencast-boder-assignment-7-posters.mp4){:target="_blank"}
- What kind of website it this?
- Where were the posters created, by whom and with what purpose?
- Would you regard these posters as belonging to the domain of art or are they purely historical sources?
