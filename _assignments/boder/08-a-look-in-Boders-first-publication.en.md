Boder reworked his basic sources, the transcripts of his interviews, to be published in his first book. In the interactive animation you can see a PDF version of part of his book. But a lot of changes occured between the recording and the way the result was pulbished in the book. This assignment shows how one source, an audio recording,  can be  represented in different forms, depending on the specific  conventions of a medium. You are going to compare the same interview, as it was published in his book in 1948, with its digital online representation that was created in 2009.
