The possibilities for reproduction of text and images increased considerably during Boder’s lifetime. As well as the mimeograph, he used the microcard to disseminate his volumes of transcripts among various universities and research institutes.
This assignment is intended to develop an understanding of how the introduction of communication technologies increased individuals’ ability to spread a message.  
Reduced costs and easy-to-manage protocols mean that lay people not familiar with printing technologies are now able to disseminate their work.
