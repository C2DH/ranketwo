The rationale of this assignment 

The statements of Iranian president Ahmadinejad in 2005 in the press are said   to be decisive for mobilizing resources to publish
all of Boder’s work online. Understandably, statements that put into question whether the
Holocaust  actually occurred, trigger heated and emotional debates. Nevertheless, each statement that appears in the press, whatever
medium,  should be subject to careful source criticism. This applies to historians as well   as to journalists. 
This assignment is meant to trace back the sources upon which the news about   the Holocaust denial  of Ahmadinejad is based
how this news spread and how   it was represented by the international press.
