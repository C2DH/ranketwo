In 1946, Edith Zierer, who was only fifteen years old, was interviewed by David Boder at the Bellevue orphanage for displaced Jewish children in Paris. The interview was conducted in German. 57 years later, in June 2003, she was interviewed again in Hebrew by an interviewer from the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum.  
The purpose of this assignment is to illustrate how the narrative on a similar topic – experiences in concentration camps and their impact on one’s life – changes over time and is determined by the age and status of both interviewer and narrator. You will be comparing features of the interview held in 1946 to the one conducted in 2003.
