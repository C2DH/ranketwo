In 1946 fifteen years old Edith Zierer was
interviewed by David Boder in Bellevue, an orphanage for
displaced Jewish children near Paris. The
interview was conducted in German. 57 years later, in June
2003, she was interviewed again in Hebrew by an interviewer
of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum.  
The purpose of this assignment is to illustrate how the 
narrative on experiences in concentration
camps and its impact on one’s life, changes over time.
You will be comparing features of the interview held
in 1946 to the one conducted in 2003.
