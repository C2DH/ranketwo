 The list of universities and research institutes that received a 
 copy of Boder’s transcripts  shows what he considered      
 important centres of  knowledge that could benefit from his 
 work. At present Boder’s legacy is concentrated in a limited 
 number of institutes, mostly within the United States. 
 This assignment is meant to juxtapose Boder’s efforts to spread 
 his work, with  the present geographical spread of institutes that 
 preserve part of his legacy.
 You will be asked to create a map and mark the places where 
 institutes hold  parts of his legacy. In addition you will conduct 
 research on how digital  communication technologies are used to 
 create online access to  Boder’s work.
