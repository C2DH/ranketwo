In 1946 fifteen years old Edith Zierer was interviewed by David Boder in Bellevue, an orphanage for displaced Jewish children near Paris. The interview was conducted in German. 57 years later, in June 2003, she was interviewed again in Hebrew by an interviewer of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum.  
The purpose of this assignment is to illustrate how the narrative on experiences in concentration camps and its impact on one’s life, changes over time. You will be comparing features of the interview held in 1946 to the one conducted in 2003.
