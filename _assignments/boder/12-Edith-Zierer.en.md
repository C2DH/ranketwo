The rationale of this assignment  

In 1946 Edith Zierer, who was only fifteen years old, was
interviewed by David Boder in Bellevue, an orphanage for
displaced  Jewish children in the neighbourhood of Paris. The
interview was conducted in German. 57 years later, in June
2003, she was interviewed  again in Hebrew by an interviewer
of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum.  
The purpose of this assignment is to illustrate  how  the
narrative on a similar topic, experiences in concentration
camps and its impact on one’s life, changes over time and is
determined by the age and status of both interviewer and
narrator. You will be comparing features of the interview held
in 1946 to the one conducted in 2003.
