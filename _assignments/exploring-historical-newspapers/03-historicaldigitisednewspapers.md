After taking measures to guarantee good quality OCR, another concern is the quality of the text retrieval by the search engine and the interaction with the audience through the interface. To find and read specific articles, a system has to be built and an interface has to be designed to enable you to query the database and access the place where the digitised newspapers are stored. The database therefore needs rich information on each of the digitised objects it contains. This information is called metadata, literally “information about data”. In general the most basic elements for books and articles are the author, the title of the publication, the date of publication and the language of the document. For newspapers, the available information is usually limited to the title of the newspaper and the date of publication of the issue. 

To turn all the digitised material into an online search environment, we need the following:
- a database where the output of the digitisation is stored (the image of each newspaper page, the OCR and the metadata), 
- an interface where you can type your query and browse the results 
- a search engine that will receive your query from the interface and look into the database to find relevant results. 

The list of results that appears on your screen is the product of the interaction between these three elements. Any errors or missing elements may be the result of a problem arising in any one of these elements. As we have seen, digitisation itself can also yield errors. Furthermore, it is important to bear in mind that because we are dealing with historical texts, spellings might have changed over time or misspellings may have occurred in the historical source itself.
