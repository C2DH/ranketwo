Names of people and locations are more prone to OCR mistakes, as they cannot be found in the dictionaries that are used to recognise printed words. This means that if the software used for digitisation has not integrated a dictionary of names, an accurate match for a query of a name relies completely on the correct identification of each single letter of the name.
