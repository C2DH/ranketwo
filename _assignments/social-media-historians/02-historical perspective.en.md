When looking at social media from a historian's perspective, it is important to remember that opinions differ between experts on how to define them as well as whether or not this form of communication existed in the pre-internet era. Much of these debates hinge on whether the technical infrastructure as such is the innovative element, or what people do with the technical infrastructure when it becomes available. From the perspective of a historian, the term "social media" is problematic, as **media** have a _social_ function by definition. In the scope of the digital era, the term can also refer to the pioneering sharing platforms that evolved in the early 2000s, such as MySpace and Friendster. At the time, they were coined _[Social Networking Sites](https://academic.oup.com/jcmc/article/13/1/210/4583062#104153860)_. With the introduction of Twitter, Pinterest, Instagram and Snapchat, arguably geared towards sharing content more than creating networks, the broader term "social media" gained traction. In this assignment, you are going to explore the historical continuities and discontinuities of the phenomenon of social media.

[Watch this TEDx Talk by journalist and computer scientist Tom Standage](https://youtu.be/ixsridS3qVs) (16 min), author of ["Writing on the Wall"](https://worldcat.org/fr/title/827256877), a short history of information sharing. Standage defines social media as media exchanged between people along social connections and creating a distributed discussion or community. In his talk, he argues that a number of historical periods and events have the same type of communication structure as present-day social media. He goes so far as to regard the era of traditional analogue media - radio, television, and film - as an exception to the practice of passing on information at a low cost that can be modified from one peer to another. In his view, the twenty-first century is a "return" to the communication structures that were common before the technological innovations of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.

In the table below, the key points of this oral presentation are listed. Your task is to check Standage’s claims about social media being the continuation of an old practice by complementing the table with the examples that he gives of social media in the past. Try to determine whether the features of the ancient social media that Standage discusses are similar or different to contemporary ones.
