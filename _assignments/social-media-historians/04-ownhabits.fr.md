### 4.a Document and compare your own use of social media
<!-- section-contents -->
One of the best ways to understand the impact and function of social media on our lives is to closely monitor your own use of it. For this assignment, you are expected to keep a log of your social media use for three consecutive days and then compare your own habits with those of three anonymous history students as well as with statistical data for your country of residence.

1. Keep a log of your own social media use with the help of the schedule below. (You can also find a copy and complete this in your answer form)

| | Which social media platform I used | Why I used it | What I felt about it | How long I used it for |
| Day&nbsp;1 | | | | |
| Day&nbsp;2 | | | | |
| Day&nbsp;3 | | | | |

2. After keeping your own log, open the link below to see the log of three  anonymous history students and note what strikes you as similar and different in their habits from your own.

3. Lastly, compare your use of social media with that of your country of residence. Use this 2021 global report on the use of social media to look up your respective country. (Simon Kemp, we are social/Hootsuite, slides 78-101)
What can you say when comparing your social media habits with those of the students above and the global report? Write down some of your thoughts and findings in a short essay (max. 250 words).
