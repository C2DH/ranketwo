In the history of social media, [Six Degrees](http://sixdegrees.com) and [Friendster](http://www.friendster.com), launched in 1997 and 2002 respectively, are two early initiatives, both of them now defunct. If these were telephone companies or daily newspapers from the early 1900s, you would probably start your research in company or government archives or in a librery. But who is responsible for preserving the content of web platforms that once were accessible worldwide and no longer exist? Hopefully there exists a nonprofit organization, the [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/), dedicated to instructing robots to make daily snapshots of web content, store this material in a database and make it retrievable through a search interface.
You are now going to conduct a historical inquiry into these two social media platforms by consulting the Internet Archive thanks to the [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/), its powerful search engine.
For a more in-depth explanation, see our [handout on how to search the Internet Archive](https://ranke2.uni.lu/assets/pdf/wayback-machine-interface.pdf).

- Put the url `http://sixdegrees.com` in the search box of the IA and search for snapshots made on 29 April 1999, such as [this one](https://web.archive.org/web/19990428073521/http://www.sixdegrees.com/). Please note that the url in question is still accessible in the web, however the website is no longer functional. 

- Open up a new tab in your browser and access again the [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/). Now search for `http://www.friendster.com` and look for the snapshots made on 1 April 2004, such as [this one](https://web.archive.org/web/20040401183007/http://friendster.com/info/moreinfo.jsp).

- You now have two start pages with several links to other pages. Compare the two by reading the homepage, checking the links that still work, and looking up information in the sections "about us", "about the company", and/or "about the site". These sections are often found in a small font at the very bottom of a page. 

For both Six Degrees and Friendster, note down the information you can find about the following elements - for some of them you may have to conduct some research on the web. 
* Creation: date, place, name of creator(s), name of company
* Objective
* Modalities of access
* Website design
* Target audience  
* Users: maximum number of users, cultural 
* Business model
* End of activity: date, reasons, evolution if any

### 5.b Archival efforts to preserve social media | 20 Min
  <!-- section-contents -->

The duty of a person or group to deposit a copy of a publication or of a government to deposit all its documents in a national library or archive is often called a "[legal deposit](https://www.ifla.org/book/export/html/8302)", although the exact term varies from country to country. Until the late XX<sup>th</sup> century, this obligation principally applied to printed materials, only rarely considering audiovisual materials. With the advent of digital technology, most legislation was extended to digital documents. While this is fairly feasible with regard to static digital content, with the increasingly dynamic, interactive, and immediate character of social media data (not to mention  the issue of copyright), cultural heritage institutions are faced with a new set of challenges.

Let us have a quick look at [Twitter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter), that you can further explore [below](https://ranke2.uni.lu/u/social-media-historians/#assignment-07-twitterascasestudy.en) <!-- attention au lien, il faut peut-être insérer un lien relatif?--> later. Please read the following two blog posts and note the arguments for and against the preservation of tweets:
- "How Tweet It Is!: Library Acquires Entire Twitter Archive" by Matt Raymond, Library of Congress Blog, 14.04.2010, <https://blogs.loc.gov/loc/2010/04/how-tweet-it-is-library-acquires-entire-twitter-archive>
 
- "Update on the Twitter Archive at the Library of Congress" by Gayle Osterberg, Library of
Congress Blog, 26.12.2017, <https://blogs.loc.gov/loc/2017/12/update-on-the-twitter-archive-at-the-library-of-congress-2>

 The first of these posts was published when the [Library of Congress](https://www.loc.gov/) announced on 14 April 2010 on its website that it was going to preserve every tweet that had been created through Twitter (tip: we propose you do not miss to go through the first 30 comments below the post as well). The second was published seven years later and reports the evolution of the project.

### 5.c Who is still covered by the Library of Congress? | 25 Min
 <!-- section-contents -->

- Read this article by Andrew McGill on how the Library of Congress (LOC) might have underestimated the problems that it would encounter in its project to archive every single Tweet ever published: "Can Twitter Fit Inside the Library of Congress?" by Andrew McGill, *The Atlantic*, 04.08.2016, <http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/08/can-twitter-fit-inside-the-library-of-congress/494339/>.

- Next, have a closer look at the Twitter account of the President of the United States [@POTUS45](https://twitter.com/POTUS45).

Screenshot of ["President Trump 45 Archived (@POTUS45)" Twitter page](https://twitter.com/POTUS45) taken on a desktop computer on 14 April 2021.

- Now try to answer the following questions in a short response of approximately 250 words. 
1. Has the Library of Congress indeed applied the criteria that they describe in their change of policy in December 2017?
2. Does this mean that these archived tweets are accessible for research? Elaborate your answer with arguments.

### 5.d What about other social media?  | 20 Min
 <!-- section-contents -->

Much attention has been given to what can be seen as an open approach of Twitter with regard to collecting tweets. But what about the many other social platforms? Do they offer the same possibilities?
Read [this paper by Helen Hockx-Yu about the difficulties of archiving social media data for cultural heritage institutions](http://library.ifla.org/999/1/107-hockxyu-en.pdf), presented at the international conference of the Federation of Libraries and Archives in 2014 in Lyon. After reading it, can you list three arguments for why archiving social media is problematic?

At the end of her paper, the author suggests alternative ways of preserving social media through key institutions that are held accountable. Now think of your daily use of social media and try to imagine the needs of a historian in the future to understand the lifestyle of young people between 2020 and 2025 (the years of Covid and its aftermath).
  - What do you think should be preserved?
  - In which way and by what means?
  - What would motivate you to make this effort of preserving your private archive?
  - What are your ideas about who owns the copyright to your work and how your privacy and that of your social circle should be dealt with?
