In the chronological list of social media referred to in assignment 3b two early initiatives are mentioned: SixDegrees.com (www.SixDegrees.com) and Friendster (http://www.friendster.com, now defunct). If these would be the names of telephone companies or daily newspapers from the early 1900’s, you would probably start your research in company or government archives. But who is responsible for preserving the content of web platforms that were accessible worldwide but no longer exist? We are lucky to have the non profit organisation, the Internet Archive, dedicated to instructing robots to make daily snapshots of whatever is published online, store this material in a database and make it retrievable through a search interface.
You are now going to conduct an historical inquiry into these two social media platforms by consulting the Internet Archive.
[see for a more in depth - our handout on how to search the Internet Archive](https://ranke2.uni.lu/assets/pdf/wayback-machine-interface.pdf)

- Put the url of  www.SixDegrees.com in the search box of the IA and search for snapshots made on April 28th 1999. https://web.archive.org/web/19990428073521/http://www.sixdegrees.com/

- Open up a new tab in your browser and now search for http://www.friendster.com  and look for the snapshots made on April 1st 2004. https://web.archive.org/web/20040401183007/http://friendster.com/info/moreinfo.jsp

- You now have 2 start pages with several links to other pages. Make a comparison between the two by reading the startpage, checking the links that still work, and looking up information in the  section ‘about us’, ‘about the company’, ‘about the site’ (often only to find in a very small font at the very bottom of a page)

- Complete this table on the basis of the info you can find:

### 5.b Archival efforts to preserve social media
  <!-- section-contents -->

The duty of a person or group to deposit a copy of a publication or of a  government to deposit all its documents to a national library or archive is described in a so-called  [‘legal deposit’](https://www.ifla.org/book/export/html/8302). The exact terms vary from country to country. What they do have in common is that until the late 20th century this obligation only applied to printed, and sometimes, audio-visual materials. With the advent of digital technology the legislation had to be extended to digital documents. This asks for different measures, but is fairly feasible with regard to static digital content. Yet, with the increasingly dynamic, interactive and immediate character of social media data, and the issue of copyright, cultural heritage institutions are faced with a set of new challenges.
Read the following two blogs and make notes on arguments pro-preservation of Tweets and arguments against:
- The Library of Congress announces on its website that it is going to preserve all tweets that have been created through Twitter, on April 14th 2010. Go through the first 30 comments on the announcement. « How Tweet It Is!: Library Acquires Entire Twitter Archive », Library of Congress Blog, 14.04.2010, <https://blogs.loc.gov/loc/2010/04/how-tweet-it-is-library-acquires-entire-twitter-archive/>

- Blog published seven years later. «Update on the Twitter Archive at the Library of Congress», Library of
Congress Blog, 26.12.2017, https://blogs.loc.gov/loc/2017/12/update-on-the-twitter-archive-at-the-library-of-congress-2/?loclr=blogloc

### 5.c Who is still covered by the Library of Congress?
 <!-- section-contents -->

- Read this article by Andrew McGill on how the LOC underestimated the problems that it would encounter by archiving the entire Twitter archive: , «Can Twitter Fit Inside the Library of Congress? », The Atlantic, 04.08.2016. <http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/08/can-twitter-fit-inside-the-library-of-congress/494339/>,

Have a closer look at this Twitter account: <https://twitter.com/POTUS45>

- Has the Library of Congress indeed applied the criteria that they describe in their change of policy in December 2017?
- Does this mean that these archived Tweets are accessible for research? Elaborate your answer with arguments.

### 5.d What about other social media?
 <!-- section-contents -->

Much attention has been given to the ‘open approach’ of Twitter with regard to access to its data. But what about the many other social platforms? Do they offer the same possibilities?
Read this paper by Helen Hockx-Yu presented at the international conference of the Federation of Libraries and Archives in 2014 in Lyon, on the difficulties of archiving social media data for cultural heritage institutions. http://library.ifla.org/999/1/107-hockxyu-en.pdf

List three important arguments for why archiving social media is problematic.

At the end of her paper, she suggests alternative ways of preserving social media, then through key institutions that are held accountable.  Imagine your daily use of social media, and the needs of a historian in 100 years time to understand the lifestyle of young people between 2020 and 2025 (the years of Covid and its aftermath)
  - What do you think should be preserved?
  - In which way and by what means?
  - What would motivate you to make this effort of preserving your private archive?
  - What are your ideas about who owns the copyright and how your privacy and that of your social circle should be dealt with?
