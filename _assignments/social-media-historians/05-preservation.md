In the chronological list of social media referred to in assignment 3b two early initiatives are mentioned: SixDegrees.com (www.SixDegrees.com) and Friendster (http://www.friendster.com, now defunct). If these would be the names of telephone companies or daily newspapers from the early 1900’s, you would probably start your research in company or government archives. But who is responsible for preserving the content of web platforms that were accessible worldwide but no longer exist? We are lucky to have the non profit organisation, the Internet Archive, dedicated to instructing robots to make daily snapshots of whatever is published online, store this material in a database and make it retrievable through a search interface.
You are now going to conduct an historical inquiry into these two social media platforms by consulting the Internet Archive. 
[see for a more in depth - our handout on how to search the Internet Archive](https://ranke2.uni.lu/assets/pdf/wayback-machine-interface.pdf)  

- Put the url of  www.SixDegrees.com in the search box of the IA and search for snapshots made on April 28th 1999. https://web.archive.org/web/19990428073521/http://www.sixdegrees.com/  

- Open up a new tab in your browser and now search for http://www.friendster.com  and look for the snapshots made on April 1st 2004. https://web.archive.org/web/20040401183007/http://friendster.com/info/moreinfo.jsp 

- You now have 2 start pages with several links to other pages. Make a comparison between the two by reading the startpage, checking the links that still work, and looking up information in the  section ‘about us’, ‘about the company’, ‘about the site’ (often only to find in a very small font at the very bottom of a page)

- Complete this table on the basis of the info you can find:


| | Facebook | Cloob | VK  | 
| *Social element of the platform* e.g.,blogging, discussing, sharing, connecting, crowdsourcing |  |  |  |  
| *Content:* What kind of content is produced on this platform? e.g., news, opinions, photos, personal stories, messages, games, films, clips, hobbies |  |  |  |  
| *Closest similar set of practices in the analogue era* e.g., pub, letter, telegraph, cinema, photo album, etc.|  |  |  |  
| *Target audience:* Who is the primary target of this platform? business or leisure? |  |  |  |  
| *Device:* What kind of device do you need to access the social medium? e.g., computer, tablet, smartphone, etc. |  |  |  | 
| Control:* Is what is posted monitored? If so, by whom and for what reason? (and if not, why not?) | | | |
| Privacy:* What does the company that runs the platform know about their users and what happens to this data? | | | |
