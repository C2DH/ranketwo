*Note: in this section, we use the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine. For a guideline on how to use this resource see: [handout Wayback machine](https://ranke2.uni.lu/assets/pdf/wayback-machine-interface.pdf). Additionally, those who already have a Twitter account will first need to log out from their account in order to be able to complete this assignment.*

Go to the present Twitter homepage: <http://www.twitter.com>

- What does the text say on the homepage?

Open the following three hyperlinks to the Internet Archive. Each one of them provides an archived version of the Twitter homepage in diferent moments in 2006, 2009 and 2015. Then, copy the texts that are displayed on the homepage of Twitter and note some of the changes over the different years, if any.

Go to this [New York Times article by Mike Isaac](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/26/technology/twitter-280-characters.html?smid=url-share). After reading it, try to answer the following questions:
- In what ways can you respond to a tweet?
- Can you “like” a tweet? Why would you?
- Can you mention a user in a tweet? Why?

- Go to <https://twitter.com/jack/status/20> and check the tweet you just accessed. 

This is the first tweet ever published. It was posted by the creator of Twitter, Jack Dorsey. Unlike other old tweets, it is still online and readable on Twitter. Compare the tweet as it is on Twitter today to two earlier snapshots of the same tweet:
- <https://web.archive.org/web/20081103142857/https://twitter.com/jack/status/20>
- <https://web.archive.org/web/20150321230408/https://twitter.com/jack/status/20>


These two snapshots are versions of the tweet archived by the [Internet Archive Wayback Machine](https://archive.org/web/). The first one is the earliest capture of it. In comparison, Jack Dorsey’s tweet, as it is currently displayed on Twitter, is not an archived but a live version - this means that Twitter users can still interact with it even today. Try to figure out some of the difficulties that archivists might encounter when they archive social media by comparing those three versions of the same Tweet in a short response below.
