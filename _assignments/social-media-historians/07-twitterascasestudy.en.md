 <!-- section-contents -->

- Go to <https://twitter.com/jack/status/20>

This is the first Tweet ever published. It was made by the creator of Twitter, Jack Dorsey. Unlike other old tweets, it is still on-line and readable on Twitter. Compare the tweet as it is on Twitter today to two earlier snapshots of the same Tweet:
- <https://web.archive.org/web/20081103142857/https://twitter.com/jack/status/20>
- <https://web.archive.org/web/20150321230408/https://twitter.com/jack/status/20>


These two snapshots are versions of the Tweet archived by the [Internet Archive Wayback Machine](https://archive.org/web/). In comparison, Jack Dorsey’s Tweet (as it is currently displayed on Twitter), is not an archived but a "live" version. Try to figure out some of the difficulties that archivistes might encounter when they archive social media by comparing those three versions of the same Tweet in a short response below.
