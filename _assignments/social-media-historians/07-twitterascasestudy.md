Go to the [Twitter beginner’s guide](https://help.twitter.com/en/new-user-faq) to answer this question:
- What is a tweet?
- What is the length (the number of characters) of a tweet at present?
- Has it always been this length?
- Why is the number of characters of a tweet limited?
- How does the limitation of characters relate to the specificity of Twitter?

Go to this [New York Times article by Mike Isaac](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/26/technology/twitter-280-characters.html?smid=url-share) 
- In what ways can you respond to a Tweet?
- Can you “like” a Tweet? Why would you?
- Can you mention a user in a Tweet? Why?

*How a Tweet is archived*

- Go to https://twitter.com/jack/status/20

This is the first tweet ever published, by the creator of Twitter Jack Dorsey. Unlike other old tweets, it is still on-line and readable on Twitter.
- Compare the tweet as it is on Twitter to these two snapshots of the same tweet: 
- https://web.archive.org/web/20081103142857/https://twitter.com/jack/status/20
- https://web.archive.org/web/20150321230408/https://twitter.com/jack/status/20


Those two snapshots are versions of the tweets archived by the Wayback Machine on archive.org. Jack Dorsey’s tweet such as it is displayed on Twitter is not an archive. But by comparing them, you can guess some difficulties that archivists meet to archive social media. Can you, by comparing those three versions of the same tweet, list some of those difficulties?
