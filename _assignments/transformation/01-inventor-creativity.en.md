All of the images from the clip ‘Transformation’ that you just saw originated somewhere else. They have been copied and pasted in a new context thanks to technologies that allow you to ‘transform’ and retrieve images. This assignment revolves around Image Recognition Software, also known as Computer Vision. You will first learn how to create a screenshot of an image and inspect its corresponding metadata. Then, you will learn how to use software to find where an image on the web originally comes from. Finally, you will analyse the image using digital source criticism tools. This will allow you to  trace the origin of the image to its publication in a digital representation in an online environment, documenting the transformations it has undergone in order to reach its most recent stage.

A screenshot (sometimes referred to as a screencap, screengrab, or in the earlier days of the internet, as a print screen), can be seen as revolutionary. The ease with which you can copy and paste an image, use it in another context, and share it with others, encourages the use and spread of images on the web. This is especially the case when the images are copyright free. The first step in exploring image recognition is using your laptop to create two screenshots of images of your choice that have been used for the animation ‘Transformation.’ 

Start by re-watching the video clip ‘Transformation.’ At any point in the video, pause it (for example, at 0:28 or 2:03), and take a screenshot of a clear image of an object or a person in the paused clip.

For Mac users, the screenshots will automatically appear on your desktop. For Windows users, 
the screenshots will appear in a folder called “Screenshots” in your “Pictures” folder.
Copy those screenshots in the two fields below.

|      | Screenshot 1             |        Screenshot 2.       |
