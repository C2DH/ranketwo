All of the images from the clip ‘Transformation’ that you just saw originated somewhere else. They have been copied and pasted in a new context thanks to technologies that allow you to ‘transform’ and retrieve images. This assignment revolves around Image Recognition Software, also known as Computer Vision. You will first learn how to create a screenshot of an image and inspect its corresponding metadata. Then, you will learn how to use software to find where an image on the web originally comes from. Finally, you will analyse the image using digital source criticism tools. This will allow you to  trace the origin of the image to its publication in a digital representation in an online environment, documenting the transformations it has undergone in order to reach its most recent stage.

### 1.a Inspect screen shots |

A screenshot (sometimes referred to as a screencap, screengrab, or in the earlier days of the internet, as a print screen), can be seen as revolutionary. The ease with which you can copy and paste an image, use it in another context, and share it with others, encourages the use and spread of images on the web. This is especially the case when the images are copyright free. The first step in exploring image recognition is using your laptop to create two screenshots of images of your choice that have been used for the animation ‘Transformation.’ 

Start by re-watching the video clip ‘Transformation.’ At any point in the video, pause it (for example, at 0:28 or 2:03), and take a screenshot of a clear image of an object or a person in the paused clip.
 (Click here for instructions on [how to take a screenshot on a Mac or a Windows computer](https://lifehacker.com/how-to-take-a-screenshot-or-picture-of-whats-on-your-co-5825771){:target="_blank"}. 
For Mac users, the screenshots will automatically appear on your desktop. For Windows users, 
the screenshots will appear in a folder called “Screenshots” in your “Pictures” folder.
Copy those screenshots in the two fields below.

|      | Screenshot 1             |        Screenshot 2.       |
| ---  |--------------------------|----------------------------|
|      |                          |                            |
|      |                          |                            |
|      |                          |                            |
|      |                          |                            |
|      |                          |                            |
|      |                          |                            |
|      |                          |                            |
|      |                          |                            |
|      |                          |                            |

Taking the screenshots automatically generates information about them that we call metadata. Metadata, which literally means “data about data”, is information about the object in question. It is a concept that is key for the management of digital content (including photos, texts, audio or video-files, tweets, or 3d objects). In the case of digitally produced images, this type of metadata is called Exif data, which stands for: 
Exchangeable Image File Format. This file contains information about the image such as the amount of pixels, the number of bytes, the colour scheme, the date of creation, and the format of the image. 

Watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABF2FvSPVYE){:target="_blank"} by metadata librarian Mary Rose of the Southern Illinois University Edwardsville Libraries that gives you an introduction to the concept of metadata by using the analogy of how we label leftovers in a fridge.

You are now going to inspect the metadata of the first of the two screenshots that you created. 
Click here for access to a PDF with an overview of all the metadata fields, how to access them, and what they mean
Using the PDF, you will see all the major fields for metadata information in the tables below. Fill out only the metadata fields that are highlighted for the first of the two screenshots you took, either in the Mac or the Windows version, while taking note of all the other types of common metadata

link to (pdf) and images of examples of metadata schemese Windows and MAC should be placed here 



Check whether or not the metadata that you looked up was correct by using the online tool https://www.metadata2go.com, which helps you find and examine the Exif and metadata of an image, in addition to providing explanations for a number of metadata categories or fields that you might not be familiar with.
