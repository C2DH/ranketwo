### 1.c  Create a new timeline | 120 min
<!-- section-contents -->

- Create your own account and a new timeline. Create at least four entries on a timeline about a topic related either to Boder’s life or to early accounts on experiences in concentration camps.

You could consider:
- Politics and societal developments:    Think of the political situation in countries that Boder lived in or travelled to: Latvia, Russia, Siberia, Japan, Mexico, United States, Europe.
- Technology : Think of  inventions with regard to recording or communication technology.
- The History of psychology : Think of the developments in this science and the creation of the US National Mental Health Association.
- The history of interview collections:  Who introduced the idea of creating collections of recordings of people’s experiences ?
- A chronological list of audio and film recordings with accounts of experiences in concentration camps: Think of war trials, television, radio, the web.

Remember to first document your research in your template, then paste it into the online timeline. This way you will always have the basis of your content on your own computer as a backup.
Also remember to regularly save your entries in your answer template, as well as in the online timeline!

Tiki-Toki gives you the possibility of upgrading your account to a teacher’s account (125 $ a year), unlocking the “group edit” feature for you and your students. The teacher’s account will provide the teacher with new features and several account keys for the students.

For assignments 1b and 1c  you must take into account the existing legal
framework governing the reuse of images on the web.
Infringement of copyright can lead to high fines. The best way to
protect yourself is to either to use copyright free material, or to make sure
the web-environment is not public, by working in a password protected
environment.

- Check which of the images that you have used for your timeline are
open source and which ones can only be used with permission.
Where can you find this information if you search on the web?

- Write a short abstract of 150-words in your template on what you have found on the web, and what you can do with it.
