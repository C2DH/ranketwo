Copying and re-using images and texts is easier than ever before since the advent of digital technology. However, during the same period the risk of infringement of the rights of an author or artist has also increased, as it becomes more difficult to control the way in which his or her work is used or to prevent other people from financially exploiting it. To diminish this risk, specific arrangements have been made to regulate the use of images on the web. This assignment focuses on these arrangements and how they can differ, sometimes greatly, from country to country.

### 2.a Taking copyright into account | 45 min 
<!-- section-contents -->

There has always been a connection between technological progress and the need to introduce new laws to protect the ideas and efforts of authors, inventors, and artists.  The first copyright law was enacted in Great Britain in 1710 to protect the rights of authors from the unauthorized reproduction of their works. A similar need evolved with the advent of digital technology and the web, which facilitated copying and spreading original works. This assignment deals with the arrangements that have been made to regulate the use of images on the web.

Digitisation has made the concept of ownership and copyright difficult to deal with.
Watch Part 4 of Everything is a Remix (22:50-34:30) by Kirby Ferguson to learn about the origin of the concept of copyright. We highly recommend that you watch the other parts of this fascinating and quirky four-part video series in your free time, which show Ferguson’s funny and shrewd insights into the world of content ownership and modification.

It is very easy to make a copy of an image on the web and the ease of this encourages the re-use and re-mix of digital content, as Ferguson explains in his video series. But just because an image exists on the web does not mean that its re-use is permitted. Even if you can easily download an image from an online magazine, this does not mean that you are dealing with copyright-free material. It is therefore important to check what the conditions are for using the image. 

Here are a number of way to check whether or not you can use an image found on the web: 
Have a careful look at the captions of the images on the website
Check whether there is a watermark; sometimes the watermark only shows when you hover over the image 
If you can download the image, inspect the Exif data (you can follow the indications given in assignment 1a for this) as the Exif metadata comes with the download and sometimes indicates the copyright information
Sometime copyright issues can be found in the section ‘Terms of Use’ of the website 
If you still can’t find details about the owner, you can try Google reverse image search, by uploading either the image or the image link into the search box. This will yield results that can help you find other websites where the image has been used.
If this does not yield results, the only thing left to do is to contact the owner of the website (also known as the webmaster) and seek contact with the copyright owner through the webmaster. 

If you unintendedly have infringed copyright law, this website offers guidelines on how to handle the problem:

I feel like we need to talk about several different types of copyright here as well. We discuss the history of copyright, how to look for the copyright info, and how copyright is different in different countries, but we don’t talk about what the different types of copyright are (i.e., commercial-use versus non-commercial use, ability to modify versus non-modifiable, etc.). We could have them read this section on different types of licenses on the Licenses page of the Creative Commons Website.

Now choose two other images from Assignment 1c, make screenshots of them, and place them in the table below. You are going to trace back the copyright arrangements or the absence of any regulation for these two images. Just as in the previous assignment, you can start by reverse image searching but this time you should only focus on tracing back the rights for reuse. Keep in mind that sometimes it is very difficult to find the copyright information for an image. If you can’t find the information, you must assume that you cannot use it. Remember: if you find nothing, use nothing.

### 2.b  Differences in copyright law. | 25 min
<!-- section-contents -->

While copyright has been introduced to protect somebody’s unique creation, the way that protection is exercised and the extent of that protection is not the same globally. While most countries in the world have some form of copyright protection, even the basics of that protection can differ widely from country to country. In this assignment, we will briefly discuss some of the differences in several various countries.


The information in the assignment above may give you the impression that copyright rules apply to all the countries in the world that are connected to the web via the internet. This is certainly not the case. In fact, copyright laws can be very different depending on the country of origin in which the material was produced or in which the creator lives. 
To get an idea of the diversity read pages 197-204 of the article [The Tangled Web: Cross-Border Conflicts of Copyright Law in the Age of Internet Sharing](https://lawecommons.luc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1178&context=lucilr) by Elisabeth Fiordalisi from the Loyola University Chicago School of Law about the differences between countries in copyright and then respond to the questions below.


- What are the essential differences in copyright law between Europe and the US according to Fiordalisi? (see page 204) 

- What is a ‘netizen’ and when was the term introduced? (Conduct additional web research) 

- If you would use an image that is licensed without permission on a website that you created in the country you live in, but that is accessible throughout the world, what would be the consequences?

### 2.c   What kind of creativity has been put in the clip ‘Transformation’? | 15 min
<!-- section-contents -->

Copyright has been introduced to protect somebody’s unique creation. When considering the variety of technologies, scripts, designs, sounds, and images that are used in an animation, one could say that it is the result of many kinds of creativities. In this assignment, you are challenged to discover which creative input was needed to put the ‘Transformation’ clip together and how we managed to keep the costs of purchasing images low. 

Watch part of the ['Transformation' clip](https://ranke2.uni.lu/u/transformation/#c-clip.en) again, keeping in mind the following questions: 

- What different kinds of expertise are needed to create such a clip? To help you out, you can have a look at the credits at the end of the clip. 

- What kind of content has been used to create the clip? (sound, text, image) To help you out, check out one of the first versions of the [storyboard that was created for the Transformation clip](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Y6V7TX3o75lHOnPznarbfz16hv0q157vvr1qT3Y688w/edit?usp=sharing).

- Have the creators of the Transformation clip taken risks with regard to the use of images? For some inspiration, take a look at columns I and J of the storyboard document above.
