In the ‘Transformation’ clip, the claim is made that digital technology enhances the processes of transformation, which is why the term is so often used in combination with that of ‘digital’. In this assignment, you are going to explore the meaning of the term ‘transformation’ as well as the related term ‘metamorphosis’. You will also trace back the changes in the meaning of both terms by using the Google Ngram Viewer tool.

### 3.a Interpretations and origins of two key terms: ‘metamorphosis’ and ‘transformation’ | 20 min
<!-- section-contents -->

The terms ‘metamorphosis’ and ‘transformation’ are related but are not synonymous. ‘Metamorphosis’ is associated with animals that are able to transform from one shape into another (even though this was not its original meaning) while ‘transformation’ is a more generic reference to ‘change’, and is commonly used in combination with ‘digital’. Both these terms are regularly used in today’s world, but to trace their original meaning or the origin of any word (also called a word’s etymology), before the advent of the internet, you had to use a printed dictionary. Digital technology can help us retrieve various interpretations of their original meanings instantaneously. It can also help with tracing back how these meanings changed over time. Yet, the importance of applying the same source criticism you would use with printed materials applies equally to information resources that one can find on the web.

In the old days, the meaning of a term would be looked up in a dictionary, of which the credibility and authority would be secured by the status of an organisation or person (normally either the publishing house or the editors). The magnitude of information resources that we can now find on the web requires us to take a number of principles into account when looking for information that is reliable. 

- In this assignment, this is what you are going to do when looking up the etymology (origin) of the words ‘metamorphosis’ and ‘transformation’ in the [Online Etymology Dictionary](https://www.etymonline.com)

- To check whether you can trust the information on any website, one strategy is to read and apply the criteria for ‘detecting CRAP’ as outlined in [this page](https://learn.canvas.net/courses/1659/pages/crap-detection) from Canvas Network’s massive open online course (or MOOC) ‘Understanding Media: Facts, Authority, and What We Believe.’ Read over this page. 

- Now, look up the etymology of the terms ’metamorphosis’ and ‘transformation’ in the [Online Etymology Dictionary](https://www.etymonline.com) and write down the origins of the two terms in your own words in the boxes below. Pay attention to the different parts of the terms, such as any prefixes, verbs, nouns, or suffixes.

### 3.b Changes in how the terms ‘transformation’ and ‘metamorphosis’ are used in language. | 55 min

The contexts in which particular terms are used is affected by technological, cultural, and economic changes in society. How the use of terms changes over time can be traced with the help of a tool called the Google Books Ngram Viewer. This is a search engine created by Google that charts the frequencies of a term in 18 million books available in the public domain in the English language that were printed between 1500 and 2008. This is done via statistical analysis of yearly counts of words. Although it is not fully representative, it can give a good impression of how the meaning of a term can change over time.

Here is the [link to the Google Books Ngram Viewer](https://books.google.com/ngrams). You enter terms in the Ngram into the search bar at the top and separate them with a comma. After pressing ‘Search lots of books,’ the Ngram viewer will then show a graph of each term you entered. Have a look at the example below with the terms ‘Albert Einstein,’ ‘Sherlock Holmes,’ and ‘Frankenstein.’ Below the graph, you can also see a set of time periods, arranged chronologically. These are links to a list of books that have been published in this period and are part of the corpus of 18 million books.

- To get a quick overview of how Google Books Ngram Viewer works, read [this article from Lifewire](https://www.lifewire.com/google-books-ngram-viewer-1616701)

### Metamorphosis 
- Now enter the term ‘metamorphosis’ in the Ngram, select the first time period where the term appears below, and glance over the books that appear in that time period.   

- What are the topics of the books with ‘metamorphosis’ in the title? In what kind of section of the library would you find them? How would they be tagged to be traced online?

- Now go to the last time period, open the link and skim the titles that appear. Is there a change in the kind of context in which the term is used? Is its meaning the same as in the first period?

- Now open up some links to other time periods. Can you find a title of a book in which the term is used in a different way?

### Transformation 
- Now put a comma after ‘metamorphosis’ and add the term ‘transformation’ to your search.

- What strikes you when you compare the two graphs?

- Compare the book titles from the first time period to the time period with a peak. Is there a difference in the topics of the books with ‘transformation’ in their title that were published in the early period and with those that were published at the peak of the graph? Identify and list the topics for the early period and for the peak. 

### Digital Transformation 
- Now delete the terms ‘metamorphosis’ and ‘transformation’ and instead search for the term ‘digital transformation’ 

- How would you characterize the topics of the books in the first time period that contain this term in the title? 

- Do you see a difference with the books listed in the last time period? 

- Conduct a search on Google with the term ‘digital transformation’.  What strikes you with regard to the contexts in which the term is most present? 


While the Good Books Ngram viewer is a useful tool, it is important to note that it also has its drawbacks. Read [this article](https://www.wired.com/2015/10/pitfalls-of-studying-language-with-google-ngram/) in the American magazine Wired about the pitfalls of using the Google Book Ngram for research.
