In the ‘Transformation’ clip, the claim is made that digital technology enhances the processes of transformation, which is why the term is so often used in combination with that of ‘digital’. In this assignment, you are going to explore the meaning of the term ‘transformation’ as well as the related term ‘metamorphosis’. You will also trace back the changes in the meaning of both terms by using the Google Ngram Viewer tool.

### 3.a Interpretations and origins of two key terms: ‘metamorphosis’ and ‘transformation’ | 20 min
<!-- section-contents -->

The terms ‘metamorphosis’ and ‘transformation’ are related but are not synonymous. ‘Metamorphosis’ is associated with animals that are able to transform from one shape into another (even though this was not its original meaning) while ‘transformation’ is a more generic reference to ‘change’, and is commonly used in combination with ‘digital’. Both these terms are regularly used in today’s world, but to trace their original meaning or the origin of any word (also called a word’s etymology), before the advent of the internet, you had to use a printed dictionary. Digital technology can help us retrieve various interpretations of their original meanings instantaneously. It can also help with tracing back how these meanings changed over time. Yet, the importance of applying the same source criticism you would use with printed materials applies equally to information resources that one can find on the web.

In the old days, the meaning of a term would be looked up in a dictionary, of which the credibility and authority would be secured by the status of an organisation or person (normally either the publishing house or the editors). The magnitude of information resources that we can now find on the web requires us to take a number of principles into account when looking for information that is reliable. 

- In this assignment, this is what you are going to do when looking up the etymology (origin) of the words ‘metamorphosis’ and ‘transformation’ in the [Online Etymology Dictionary](https://www.etymonline.com)

- To check whether you can trust the information on any website, one strategy is to read and apply the criteria for ‘detecting CRAP’ as outlined in [this page](https://learn.canvas.net/courses/1659/pages/crap-detection) from Canvas Network’s massive open online course (or MOOC) ‘Understanding Media: Facts, Authority, and What We Believe.’ Read over this page. 

- Now, look up the etymology of the terms ’metamorphosis’ and ‘transformation’ in the [Online Etymology Dictionary](https://www.etymonline.com) and write down the origins of the two terms in your own words in the boxes below. Pay attention to the different parts of the terms, such as any prefixes, verbs, nouns, or suffixes.
