### 1a. Where the images come from that have been used in the clip Transformation?
<!-- section-contents -->

intro text

In this assignment you are challenged to trace the origin of the images that have been re-used in this clip.
They have been copied and pasted in a new context. This is possible because of technologies that allow to ‘transform’ an image.
There are also technologies that allow to retrieve images. These have been used to collect the material for the clip, and you are going
to use them, to trace the origin of the material, not on the basis of text retrieval, the usual way to use search engines,
but on the basis of image retrieval, a technique that is rapidly improving.


- View the clip again and choose 4 images. Stop the clip and make print screens of them

(What is a print screen? What happens in your computer? - explain throgh clip? )

- Click on the right lower corner of your mouse when hoovering over the image on your screen
- if you have a windows computer you will see this:xxxxxx
- If you have a Mac computer you will see this:  click on get info xxxxxxxxx

Explain various functions


- Now set your browser to google image: you have the possibility of uploading the print screen that you have made.
- But before uploading your print screens, watch this TED lecture about image retrieval;  [add link ]

- Now upload your image, and also drag it to the first column of the table
Assess the results of the image retrieval. What is the most likely source from which the image has been taken? Add the links to the table
What can you say about the resemblances?

- Now watch this clip about how color images are represented on your screen, [add link DARIAH Teach]

Now you are going to trace information about how the structure of the information on your screen is determined by code:
If you have a Windows computer go to:
If you have a MAC computer go to:

Explanation of various functions:

Now we go back to the front end,

Choose one or two of the sources and try to trace what the function is of the image (part of database that is offered online, illustration of an article, advertising, education)
Try to trace when  it has been published online? Explain what you did to trace it

Conduct research on the origin of the image, or the object that has been photographed or drawn, what is the analogue context of this image?

How does the technique work:
Material, technique of reproduction,

Is the image freely available on the web? Do you have to pay for it? To whom and why? What are the rights of this institution, company or person?

Now watch this video clip about the origin of copyright
Add link - everything is a remix

 [we need table here]

- Most likely web resource from where the image has been copied/puchased
- What is the origin of the image?
- Author,
- Date
- Objective and context
- When published on line for the first time, by whom and with which purpose?
- person responsible
- Date
- Objective and context
- Is it free or do you have to pay to use it?
- Why?
