At the end of the ‘Transformation’ clip, the question of whether or not we can trust digital technologies and the web is raised. The very existence of this teaching platform that can be accessed by anyone throughout the world at no cost other than an internet connection illustrates the enormous potential benefit of this technology. But as with anything in excess, there can be detrimental effects of exorbitant use of the web and of specific applications. There is the risk of addiction to video games or social media as well as the risk of isolation when people substitute digital connections for physical ones. You can end up in a filter bubble, meaning that you only receive and listen to information that connects and confirms your preferences and worldview. The risk that is most talked about at present, is that of the mobilizing power of unreliable and misleading news, also known as ‘fake news’. In these assignments, you are going to deal with the diverse ways in which digital technology can impact our lives.

### 5.a Can we trust the digital? Mental health issues | 35 min 
<!-- section-contents -->

One of the negative effects of excessive uses of the web and digital applications is the risk of increased depression and loneliness. As people substitute digital connections for physical ones, these negative effects are having larger and larger impacts around the world. In this assignment, you are going to learn about the context of some of these adverse effects.

- Listen to the first 22 ½ minutes of [this podcast](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/we-cant-just-log-off-mental-health-and-tech/id1439658455?i=1000452023198) by entrepreneur Anil Dash, titled: _We Can't Just Log Off: Mental Health and Tech_, in which he talks about both the positive and negative potential of the web. 

- List one positive and one negative feature in Dash’s account.
- Positive:
- Negative:

- Do you recognize some of the elements in Dash’s account in your own life? Reflect on your own experience with the internet or a smartphone in different phases of your life: as a child, an adolescent, a university student, (and potentially even) as an adult with a job or hobby. Some themes/keywords that might help jump-start your reflections are: fascination, fun, disappointment, bullying, learning, sharing, contact at a distance, mobilizing people for an initiative, or being deceived.
- Child:
- Adolescent:
- Student:
- Adult:

- One of the experts who is interviewed by Anil Dash is Dr. Elias Aboujaoude, who is also mentioned in Assignment 4a. Dr. Aboujaoude discusses two elements that distinguish the transformation of society after the introduction of technologies such as the telephone, radio, and television, on the one hand, and after the introduction of the world wide web, on the other (6:46 - 9:04). Describe the two distinguishing features below:

- Do you agree with Dr. Aboujaoude’s opinion about the impact of social media and app use  on society? What are your personal experiences with this effect?  (13:43 - 16:27)

- What are Dr. Aboujaoude’s thoughts on tools or utilities that web developers create to manage their own mental health or unhealthy behaviors? (16:27 - 18:55). Would you trust such an application to check whether you need to consult or go straight to a doctor?

### 5.b Can we trust the digital? The origin and character of fake news | 80 min
<!-- section-contents -->

Source criticism is essential for both historians and journalists; the crucial difference between the two is the time frame. Journalists cover contemporary facts and events, whereas historians analyse the past (and have the advantage of hindsight). One of the biggest challenges for historians is to understand both the selection and the manipulation processes that determine which historical sources are available, retrievable, and trustworthy online. Fortunately for historians, the risk of running into a forged copy of a document is relatively low compared to the amount of flawed information journalists are confronted with on a daily basis. To be able to trust the digital, we have to combine the critical approach of both historians and journalists. In this assignment, you are going to learn about the evolution of the concept of ‘fake news’ and why we have a natural tendency to be attracted to features of fake news. 

‘Fake news’ has been a much debated topic in the last four years, especially in relation to the US presidency of Donald Trump and his distrust of the press. 
- On the website of the Centre for Information technology from the University of Santa Barbara, go to the page [A Citizen's Guide to Fake News](https://www.cits.ucsb.edu/fake-news).
- Click on the tab on the left titled, [‘A Brief History of Fake News’](https://www.cits.ucsb.edu/fake-news/brief-history), and read about the fact that while the concept has a much longer history than you might think, the way in which it is now being generated has changed dramatically in recent years.
- Next, read the tab on the left titled, ['Where Does Fake News Come From?'](https://www.cits.ucsb.edu/fake-news/where) where you will find information on what is specific about ‘fake news’ in comparison with flawed information that is incorrect and misleading.
- After reading these two texts, complete the table below and mark the differences between incorrect or misleading news in general and news that is created by misusing the characteristics of digital technology.

|                     | Incorrect or misleading news | Fake news |
|---------------------|------------------------------|-----------|
| Who is creating it? |                              |           |
| How is it created?  |                              |           |
| What is it about?   |                              |           |

Now, read the tab titled, [‘Why We Fall for Fake News’](https://www.cits.ucsb.edu/fake-news/why-we-fall) about the role that cognitive biases play in how our brain interprets information.

Four aspects of this bias are listed below. Reflect on how these aspects play a role in your appreciation of news.
- Hint: think of news on controversial issues. Examples might include Brexit, coronavirus, the climate crisis, the increasing numbers of refugees in Europe in recent years, the war in Syria, the news coverage of populist parties, and the news coverage of some of the largest and most influential companies in the world, such as Amazon, Microsoft, Google, or Apple.

- Do you tend to only read the headlines?
- Are you ever critical about a message coming from social media that is appealing to you? 
- Are you able to be critical about a message that matches your worldview?
- Do you think you would be able to speak out when your peers or people in your social network believe information that has been proven to be false?

If you click on the link in the caption of the Wikipedia cognitive bias visualisation shown at the end of the [‘Why We Fall for Fake News’](https://www.cits.ucsb.edu/fake-news/why-we-fall) tab and then click on the + to magnify the image, you will end up with [this high-resolution image](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a4/The_Cognitive_Bias_Codex_-_180%2B_biases%2C_designed_by_John_Manoogian_III_%28jm3%29.png ) of the four categories of biases:
1. What Should We Remember?
2. Need To Act Fast
3. Too Much Information
4. Not Enough Meaning

In the table below, there is a list of psycho-sociological reflexes, each of which belongs in one of the four categories. Look up which category they belong in and put the matching number (1, 2, 3, or 4) after each term.

| Psycho-sociological Reflex   | Category |
|------------------------------|----------|
| The lake Wobegone effect     |          |
| Occam’s razor                |          |
| The Ikea effect              |          |
| The Peltzman effect          |          |
| The Google effect            |          |
| The Bader Meinhof phenomenon |          |
| The Weber-Fechner law        |          |
| Spacing effect               |          |
| The Semmelweis reflex        |          |
| The Ostrich effect           |          |
| Paredolia                    |          |
| Murphy’s law                 |          |
| Zero sum bias                |          |
| Bike shedding effect         |          |
| Hyperbolic discounting       |          |
| Peak and rule                |          |
| The Halo effect              |          |
| The Spotlight effect         |          |
| The Von Restorff effect      |          |
| Masked Man fallacy           |          |

Now, choose two of the biases from each category, conduct web research, and add a short explanation (75 words max.) of their meaning in the table below

| Category                    | Bias                                    |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| 1. What Should We Remember? | Cognitive Bias 1 -   Cognitive Bias 2 - |
| 2. Need To Act Fast         | Cognitive Bias 1 -   Cognitive Bias 2 - |
| 3. Too Much Information     | Cognitive Bias 1 -   Cognitive Bias 2 - |
| 4. Not Enough Meaning       | Cognitive Bias 1 -   Cognitive Bias 2 - |

Can you think of a topic in which you have recognized one of the effects described above in your own appreciation of news or knowledge?

### 5.c Ways of checking the reliability of information on the web: From fact checking to the CRAP test | 40 min
<!-- section-contents -->

The democratic nature of the web is both a blessing and a curse. The ease with which information can be published and spread without the filter of an expert opens up space for diverse voices, but at the same time it creates opportunities for manipulation and intentionally misleading the public. In the previous assignment, you learned about the evolution and specific character of ‘fake news’. In this assignment, you are going to explore different strategies to check the reliability of news.  

In the webpage, [A Citizen's Guide to Fake News](https://www.cits.ucsb.edu/fake-news/protecting-ourselves-fact) from Assignment 5b, the suggestions for verifying news are focused on assessing the quality of fact-checking websites, in order to be able to weigh the reliability of politically-oriented news in the United States.

What is the advice they give with regard to verifying information? Hint: Look at the tab ‘[Why We Fall for Fake News](https://www.cits.ucsb.edu/fake-news/why-we-fall).’

Another way to assess the reliability of information on the web is by using the acronym CRAP (also discussed in Assignment 3a), which stands for:
- Currency
- Reliability/relevance
- Authority
- Purpose/Point of view 

This acronym is said to come from the writer and journalist Ernest Hemingway, when asked what he regarded as a crucial skill to become a good journalist. It is said his answer was a good journalist needs ‘a built-in, shock proof, crap detector.’ Another famous quote with regard to the importance of distinguishing truth from lies is also attributed to an American writer, the author [Mark Twain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Twain), without any evidence to verify the claim.

Watch [this short Ted Ed lecture](https://youtu.be/cSKGa_7XJkg) from Noah Tavlin which starts off with Twain’s quote and explains a recurrent feature in coverage of news called ‘circular reporting.’

List one of the examples given in the video that relates to English-speaking countries:

Doing your own web research, try to find a similar example in a different language (Fr, Ger, Sp, It, Nl, Dan, etc.):

We are now going to apply the CRAP principle to a number of web resources. Go to the website of the university Sewanee in Tennessee and open [this guideline to CRAP](https://library.sewanee.edu/ld.php?content_id=29815361). Try to answer the four key questions of two web resources (listed below) in two languages that you speak. You can also try out languages that you do not speak by using Google translate or another translation tool.
