In the clip above, engineer Lars Wieneke explains how over time web technologies increasingly broadened the range and scale of data that could be shared and shown through the web. To illustrate these changes he elaborates on the two websites about the interview collection of the psychologist David Boder, the topic of another lesson on Ranke2, that were developed in 2000 and 2009.
Understanding the changes brought about by software such as Flash Player and languages such as XML (Extensible Markup Language) and PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor) is crucial in being able to apply source criticism to a website. However, as historians we should first place the topic into its historical context: how did websites evolve in the first place and what technologies were needed to make them work?
These assignments will briefly explore the history of the web and the technological developments that make it work. They will then dive into the differences between the web and the internet, before discussing the physical infrastructure that allows the world to be globally connected.

### 1.a The history of the web and the technology behind it | ? Min
<!-- section-contents -->

-	For a brief overview of the history of the web and the technologies involved, read Sections 1, 2, 3 and 6 of “How the World Wide Web (WWW) works” by Chris Woodford (2006/2020) (https://www.explainthatstuff.com/howthewebworks.html)
-	For an insight into the role of one of the game changers in the history of the web, computer scientist Tim Berners-Lee, read this article by the World Wide Web Foundation: “History of the Web” (https://webfoundation.org/about/vision/history-of-the-web/) 
-	For an insight into the differences between Web 1.0, Web 2.0 and Web 3.0, read this concise history of web technologies: https://thebytestory.com/2018/11/09/a-short-history-on-web-technologies/

Now that you have some more information about the development of the web and about Tim Berners-Lee, answer the following questions:
-	Why was Tim Berners-Lee’s innovation fundamental for the development of the web? 
-	What is the difference between HTTP and HTML?
-	What is a URI/URL?
-	What is the difference between a web server and a web browser?
-	What is the main difference between Web 1.0, Web 2.0 and Web 3.0 technologies?

### 1.b The difference between the web and the internet
<!-- section-contents -->

Most people use the terms “web” and “internet” interchangeably as they are very closely linked to each other, even though they are, in fact, two different things. In order to help you understand the crucial differences between the two, watch these two informative and humorous videos: 
-	“What is the world wide web? – Twila Camp” from TED-Ed (2014) (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8hzJxb0rpc) (3.50 mins)
-	“The Web Is Not The Net” by VSauce (2014) (https://youtu.be/scWj1BMRHUA?t=34), only from 00:34 to 05:04

After watching the video explanations from Twila Camp and VSauce, note the xxx most important differences between the internet and the web.

To connect the differences between the web and the internet to your own use of both, here is a list of common things that people do with their smartphones or computers for which they need the internet and/or the web. Put a cross in the right column(s).  


| | Common things done on a computer/smartphone | Uses the internet but not the web | Uses both the internet and the web | 
| Searching for a picture on Google	|  |  |  |  
| Using Skype for a video call |  |  |  |  
| Checking email with an application |  |  |  |  
| Looking at your Facebook or Instagram feed on a web browser|  |  |  |  
| Sharing a file with someone via a peer-to-peer file network |  |  |  |  
| Downloading a file from a website |  |  |  |  
| Making a call via FaceTime |  |  |  |

### 1.c The materiality of the internet
<!-- section-contents -->

Even if we understand the principles, history and evolution of the internet and the web, it can still be hard to fully grasp the materiality of our information systems. Where do we find tangible traces of the internet in our environment and what do they look like?
Despite frequent references to “the cloud” and “cyberspace” and the widespread use of WiFi (all of which contribute to the belief that the web and the internet are intangible and transparent), the internet in fact consists of highly tangible elements. For an introduction to how the internet works, watch this TED lecture by Andrew Blum: “What is the Internet, really?” (2012) (https://youtu.be/XE_FPEFpHt4) (12 mins).

-	Is this information new to you? How does it compare to what you imagined the internet to be?
-	What is meant by the line “wired people should know something about wires”? (min. 11.34)

Now take a look at this “Submarine Cable Map 2015” by Telegeography (https://submarine-cable-map-2015.telegeography.com/) 
The map looks old but it was created in 2015. 
-	Where do you notice the highest and lowest concentration of cables? What does this suggest with regard to power and control in world politics? 
-	Conduct some additional web research and find out how many undersea cables have been built since and now exist in total (don’t forget to cite your source).

### 1.d Information systems and power 
<!-- section-contents -->

The placement of underwater cables is not random; it is heavily influenced by history. New communication systems are generally rooted in the infrastructures of previous systems. These developments do not only reflect progress in technology, they are also an expression of power relations. It matters a lot who is connected to whom as well as who pays for and controls information systems. Watch these two videos and then answer the essay question below:

-	“Thin underwater cables hold the internet. See a map of them all” by Vox (2015) (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ve810FHZ1CQ) (3 mins) 
-	“Bundled, Buried & Behind Closed Doors” by Ben Mendelsohn (2011) – Vimeo video about 60 Hudson Street and the materiality of the internet (https://vimeo.com/30642376) (10 mins)

Write a short essay of 500 words in which you incorporate the answers to the following questions: 
-	What were the predecessors of the internet cables at the bottom of the ocean?  
-	Why were they laid, for what reason and by whom?
-	What do you think is the connection with regard to the division of power worldwide between those who had the resources to invest in the system of underwater telegraph cables in the past, and those who at present have taken up this role for fibreglass cables? 
-	Who was the owner of these systems in the 19th century, and who owns the cables that are laid out to connect us with the internet worldwide? What are the implications of this ownership for freedom of information?
