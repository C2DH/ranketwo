In the clip above, engineer Lars Wieneke explains how over time web technologies increasingly broadened the range and scale of data that could be shared and shown through the web. To illustrate these changes he elaborates on the two websites about the interview collection of the psychologist David Boder, the topic of another lesson on Ranke2, that were developed in 2000 and 2009.
Understanding the changes brought about by software such as Flash Player and languages such as XML (Extensible Markup Language) and PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor) is crucial in being able to apply source criticism to a website. However, as historians we should first place the topic into its historical context: how did websites evolve in the first place and what technologies were needed to make them work?

-	For an insight into the role of one of the game changers in the history of the web, computer scientist Tim Berners-Lee, read this article by the World Wide Web Foundation: “History of the Web” (https://webfoundation.org/about/vision/history-of-the-web/) 
-	For an insight into the differences between Web 1.0, Web 2.0 and Web 3.0, read this concise history of web technologies: https://thebytestory.com/2018/11/09/a-short-history-on-web-technologies/

Now that you have some more information about the development of the web and about Tim Berners-Lee, answer the following questions:
-	Why was Tim Berners-Lee’s innovation fundamental for the development of the web? 
-	What is the difference between HTTP and HTML?
-	What is a URI/URL?
-	What is the difference between a web server and a web browser?
-	What is the main difference between Web 1.0, Web 2.0 and Web 3.0 technologies?

### 1.b The difference between the web and the internet
<!-- section-contents -->

Most people use the terms “web” and “internet” interchangeably as they are very closely linked to each other, even though they are, in fact, two different things. In order to help you understand the crucial differences between the two, watch these two informative and humorous videos: 
-	“What is the world wide web? – Twila Camp” from TED-Ed (2014) (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8hzJxb0rpc) (3.50 mins)
-	“The Web Is Not The Net” by VSauce (2014) (https://youtu.be/scWj1BMRHUA?t=34), only from 00:34 to 05:04

After watching the video explanations from Twila Camp and VSauce, note the xxx most important differences between the internet and the web.
