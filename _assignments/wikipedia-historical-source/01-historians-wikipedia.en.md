The launch of Wikipedia in 2001 sparked discussions and debates among historians and scholars in the humanities and social sciences. Some scholars saw Wikipedia as representing a novel, web-based and crowdsourced model of historical knowledge production beyond traditional academic historical writing based on research expertise and peer review. Those scholars saw Wikipedia as an intellectual opportunity to redefine historical writing and adapt it to the needs and challenges of the digital age. Other scholars criticised Wikipedia for including low-quality and superficial information written by people without any expertise and exploiting free labour to keep its content alive, and for its gender- and race-related disparities in terms of community members and thematic coverage. In spite of these debates, historians now embrace the use of Wikipedia in their research and teaching. This assignment sets out to consider Wikipedia from a historical perspective and demonstrate why it matters for historians.

### 1.a Background information on Wikipedia | 45 mins
<!-- section-contents -->

In 2000, the United States based entrepreneur, [Jimmy Wales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Wales){:target="_blank"}, wanted to create an online [encyclopedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encyclopedia){:target="_blank"} similar to past encyclopedias like the [Encyclopedia Britannica](https://www.britannica.com/), in which knowledge production would be based on a system of review by experts in every field. Wales created [Nupedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nupedia){:target="_blank"}, which went online in September 2000 (Salor 2012). However, Wales soon realised that the process of creating and editing articles in Nupedia demanded a lot of time, as each topic had to be studied professionally and sent to experts for review. At the same time, Jimmy Wales and his colleagues became aware of the success of open-source software that allowed collaborative work, so they decided to change the structure and model of Nupedia and to create an encyclopedia based on the principles of sharing and openness. They turned to the [WikiWikiWeb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WikiWikiWeb){:target="_blank"} software developed by the programmer Ward Cunningham in the 1990s, which allowed anyone to create, edit and instantly save a web page (Rosenzweig 2009; Lih 2009). The software also allowed collaborative editing. By mid-January 2001, Wales and his colleagues had followed that model and changed the encyclopedia’s name to Wikipedia. Wikipedia went from being a free and online encyclopedia of experts to an encyclopedia in which “anyone could edit any page at any time” (Lih 2009). It soon gave rise to a new community of people, who actively engage with its content. By the end of 2001, Wikipedia had 15,000 articles and 350 editors (Poe 2006).

To explore how a new encyclopedia model was born in the Internet era, please watch the following YouTube video:

To better understand how and why Wikipedia was created and what new characteristics it brought in terms of knowledge production, please watch the YouTube video below, in which you will find a presentation of Wikipedia by its founder, Jimmy Wales, from 2007.

Once you have watched the videos, try to answer the following questions and discuss your answers with your fellow students:
- How do you explain the transition from the traditional model of Nupedia to the innovative model of Wikipedia? Try to find at least three major reasons – hint: think about the technology used, business model, copyright issues, practices of knowledge construction, etc.
- How and why has Wikipedia managed to become a self-regulated community consisting of millions of users, who constantly create and update its content?
- Which characteristics of Wikipedia as presented in the video did you as historians find most interesting?
- How do these characteristics affect historical knowledge production in the digital age?

### 1.b Why does Wikipedia matter for historians? | 25 mins
<!-- section-contents -->

In 2021, the American Historical Association published [a study on how the American public perceives and understands the past](https://www.historians.org/research-and-publications/perspectives-on-history/september-2021/a-snapshot-of-the-publics-views-on-history-national-poll-offers-valuable-insights-for-historians-and-advocates){:target="_blank"}. The study was based on a national survey of 1,816 people and offered an up-to-date overview of the public’s view of history. According to the AHA study, 46% of respondents use Wikipedia as a source of historical knowledge, to learn about history and acquire a historical understanding of the past. Wikipedia was ranked higher than other historical activities, such as “Historic site visit”, “Museum visit”, “Genealogy work”, “Social media”, “Podcast/radio program”, “History lecture” and “History-related video game”. These findings, together with the current appropriation of Wikipedia’s corpus by [ChatGPT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT) and Wikipedia’s partnerships with the most popular online search engine, Google, and other digital assistants such as [Siri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siri){:target="_blank"} and [Alexa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Alexa){:target="_blank"}, show what a crucial role Wikipedia has in how the public learns about history and makes sense of the past away from traditional academic and publishing spaces. 

Based on your personal experience with Wikipedia, try to answer the questions below. If you are in a class, you can discuss your answers with your fellow students:

- Have you used Wikipedia before? If so, try to describe exactly how and why you used it, for example to share your knowledge on a particular topic, to look for information, to make use of available data, etc.
- Have you ever used Wikipedia while investigating historical questions? If so, please explain: 
  - Why did you choose Wikipedia?
  - Did Wikipedia help you to answer the questions?
  - Were there particular parts of the articles you referred to that were more useful than others?
  - Did you check the sources?
  - Did you use other knowledge sources as well as Wikipedia?
  - Did you encounter mistakes? 

Now watch this video where the US historian [Jim Grossman](https://www.historians.org/person/jim-grossman/){:target="_blank"} evokes different possible uses of Wikipedia by historians:

<!-- Intelligent Channel. [“Wikipedia, history, and historians – Jim Grossman in INT’s ENLIGHTENMENT MINUTES.”](https://youtu.be/S-Yj7V6d54Q){:target="_blank"} YouTube video. 4:32 mins.-->   

Once you have watched the video, discuss and try to answer the following questions, again based on your knowledge about Wikipedia and your personal experience:
- In what ways can historians use Wikipedia? 
- Can historians use Wikipedia for historical research? If so, what sort of historical questions could it be used to answer? 

To answer these questions, you might like to consult your library’s catalogue, scientific databases or the wider web to find references to historical works that focus one way or another on Wikipedia.
