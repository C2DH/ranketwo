Wikipedia articles include historical narratives about the past. In other words, they tell a story about the past. These stories are the result of collaborative writing between Wikipedia users. Each article has a different structure based on various combinations of standardised sections (e.g. chapters, sections, infoboxes, hyperlinks), including visual and audio elements (e.g. graphs, videos, images, sounds) and bibliographical references. Now that you have a better understanding of how Wikipedia works, let’s look at the historical narrative of a Wikipedia article.

> You can adapt the proposed exercise to focus on an article about a historical event, person or phenomenon of your choice, in a language you are more comfortable with. Examples include the Haitian revolution, the Arab Spring, the Silk Road, Cleopatra, feminism and slavery, but there are countless others to choose from.

### 3.a Deconstructing a Wikipedia narrative on a historical event | 60 mins
<!-- section-contents -->

Browse the article on the [September 11 attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_11_attacks){:target="_blank"}  in the English edition of Wikipedia, and focus on the following elements: 

- How the historical narrative of the Wikipedia article is structured and how it differs from traditional historical narratives that you can find in a book or an article. 

- The visual and audio materials that are part of the article’s narrative. Please pay particular attention to the terms and conditions of use of these elements. 

- The bibliography that the editors have used, the hyperlinks, and the references to other historical events. 

Then think critically and try to answer the following questions:

- How have Wikipedia users organised the historical narrative of the Wikipedia article?
- What kind of visual and audio materials (e.g. graphs, videos, images, sounds, etc.) does the Wikipedia article include? How do these materials affect the historical narrative of the article?
- How do hyperlinks work and how do they affect the way a potential user reads and understands the article?
- How would you characterise the types of reference works that Wikipedia users cite in the article? Do they use academic literature, journalism or other types of material? Are the cited works available online?
- Do you detect any similarities or differences between the bibliographical references used in a Wikipedia article and the references used in academic books or articles?
