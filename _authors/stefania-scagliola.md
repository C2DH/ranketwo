Stefania took up the challenge of creating Ranke.2, an online teaching resource for lecturers and students of history with lessons on how to apply source criticism to digital content published online. The basis for this platform was laid by prof. Andreas Fickers, the director of C2DH. Backed up by her colleague researchers and PhDs at the C2DH, and in collaboration with the LU Media Centre, the animation company Allthinsmoving and computer scientist and web designer Daniele Guido, she conceptualized and developed this teaching resource.
