            en_us: "An important term that has emerged in the debate surrounding online privacy and government tracking is metadata. Metadata is used to refer to information about a particular set of communications that is not the content of those communications. So the subject line of an email, rather than its contents. Or the location that a text message was sent, rather than its contents. While metadata seems like it might be safer to collect, it can still be used to uncover information about individuals that could constitute a violation of privacy.\n\nCredits: Talking: Geoffrey Challen (Assistant Professor, Computer Science and Engineering, University at Buffalo).

While oral historians consider interview recordings a central historical artifact, these recordings sit unused after a written transcript is produced. We hypothesized that this is largely because books are more usable than recordings. Therefore, we created Books with Voices: bar-code augmented paper transcripts enabling fast, random access to digital video interviews on a PDA. We present quantitative results of an evaluation of this tangible interface with 13 participants. They found this lightweight, structured access to original recordings to offer substantial benefits with minimal overhead. Oral historians found a level of emotion in the video not available in the printed transcript. The video also helped readers clarify the text and observe nonverbal cues.'

        abstract:
            en_us: "In this paper, the assertion of “Big Data” being a “paradigm shift” in science is being discussed. Lagoze firstly challenges the definition of Big Data by Laney as 3Vs(Volume, Velocity and Variety) and the other definition by Mayer-Schonberger for stating the “allness” property and the shift in analytical technique from causality to correlation. He claims that these two definitions have not successfully shown Big Data as a revolutionary step in science.\n He then draws a line between “Lots of Data” and “Big Data” by saying that a paradigm shift in sciences is supposed to affect the epistemological and sociotechnical aspects not only methodological in the case of the former. Some papers are mentioned in astronomy and biology which challenge the characteristics of “completeness” and “no more searches for causalities”  by discussing that they cannot be achievable. \nLater, the concept of data integrity is introduced as a concern with the growth of “Big Data” usage in science which deals with the questions of data provenance and, origination and trust which is a necessary component of credible science. In order to discuss data integrity, the concept of “control zones” is defined with the use of “library memes” to depict clear boundaries in data control by illustrating the walls of traditional libraries.  By the growth of Web and internet, these so-called control zones are diminishing in the use of Big Data. The creation of meta-data –rich archives of social sciences such as ICPSR and UK Data Archive, the use of social network data, and crowd source citizen science are the examples of the fracture in control zones in scientific data and demonstrate the undermining of control zones with the use of Big Data which will leads to a paradigm shift due to the sociotechnical changes in data gathering methods. \nMoreover, he suggests an epistemological approach towards Big Data which should raise the awareness about “Big Data” integrity, biases and overfitting, and a methodological approach which suggest the control over the provenance and reliability of data by technological methods.\n"

        reference: 'Trevor Owens, Digital Sources & Digital Archives: The Evidentiary Basis of Digital History'
        abstract:
            en_us: 'This essay sets out to assess what the implications are for the methods of the historian now that we are increasingly building our evidence on digital sources that are retrieved from digital archives published on the web. This creates a ''digital context'' that is quite different from the original context of the source and can affect the apprecitation of a source. To emphasize the continuity in the principle of source criticism, the author cites a German classic in historiography, the historian Gustav Droysen, who already in 1867 stressed the importance of trying to understand the relation between the source and its creator. The very first consideration should be the context of the selection process for digitization. With regard to quality of the surrogate digital copy it depends on the relevance of the artifactual or informational qualities of the source what kind of resolution suffices. When it comes to the assessment of the abudance of sources offered on the web, contextualisation is again key. ''Screwing around'' as Steven Ramsey has coined browsing on the web, is an adequate method for preliminary research, but once a topic or research question has been defined, one should delve into the original context of the making of the document and of its related sources. A key difference between analog and digital born sources is that the latter are merely an illusion as they consist of a sequence of markings. To be able to solve problems that will occur with consulting sources created on older versions of software, one has to acquire some basic knowledge of the history of software and of digital carriers and be conscious of the hidden layers of information that are not visible on the screen without applying special functions. Another crucial difference with analog sources is that consulting archived digital objects will yield different results at different times, according to the choice and availabilty of certain features and the webbrowsers that one uses. Each intemerdiary layer of software is one in the sequence of interpretations of content. Other relevant differences with analog objects, are the immense scale of production and the disappearance of the distinction between original and copy. Again context in the form of often hidden metadata is essential and knowledge of the social conventions of the medium. A crucial change in the shift from document to data, is the role of ''search'' at the expense of linear order. While its dominance is increasing, our capability of preserving its context is quite limited. This means we will not be able to reconstruct the exact context of someone searching for particular images in a particular time period. In the last part of the essay Owens characterizes different types of digital archives. He distiguishes: aggregated collections of digitized primary sources which allow to bring material that is dispersed in different places together, digitized copies of the entire contents of an archival collection, born digital archival collections, web archives and collections of user generated digital born content. Owens concludes by observing that the recquirements for source criticism have stayed the same, but the skills to be able to cope with the new information ecology require knowledge of information technology.

        abstract:
            en_us: "Do historians need a new auxiliary science to analyze born-digital sources or do we have to rethink source criticism as a whole for the challenges that historians are facing in the upcoming years? This is the central question of Schreiber’s article. Schreiber gives several examples that historians have to use born-digital source to do historical research in the future: we can’t understand our Zeitgeschichte without them, it is helpful for network analysis or for statistical purposes. The author argues that born-digital source criticism can easily integrated in the way we’re doing history nowadays. In fact, based on several examples Schreiber shows that historians only have to slightly adjust and rethink their traditional ways of analyzing sources: 1) there is no such thing as “a digital source”. Like the other sources we’re analyzing, we have to recognize that every born-digital source has its singularities. 2) born-digital sources are multidimensional. They differ in the way they are created, received or interconnected, like traditional sources. 3) Born-digital sources are reliable and authentic; even if they are fake. In this case historians have to ask why they have been faked. 4) Digital sources have a complex spatial and temporal setting, just as traditional sources. 5) Born-digital sources are multimodal. That implies that the manifestations of these sources can differ. \nSchreiber suggests the concept of “Korrealismus” as a source-critical approach. By that she wants to integrate a certain spirit in her historical research. The concept has its roots in architecture (Friedrich Kiesler (1947). She wants to question historical sources before they are materialized. By that she means that she doesn’t want to interpret the “final product” but the idea behind the source"

        abstract:
            en_us: "Digital media create new challenges for historians and change their way of analyzing sources and their relationship with digital material. A choice that was unimaginable even some years ago has now become a reality: historians work either with a clearly delimited number of material, or with a huge amount of sources that they could never analyze all individually in their lifetime. Historians need to adapt their methods accordingly, but the basic historical questions should always stay at the heart of a historian’s task: how and why. Sternfeld criticizes that these questions – why did something happen and why is it important, and how did this phenomenon happen – have been often ignored in digital history. Even if traditional ways of history would not be appropriate for working with millions of sources, digital methods cannot ignore the basic questions of history and need critical thinking.\nSternfeld discusses two concepts in his article: scale and appraisal. The former concerns the question of level at which historical enquiries take place. While traditional historical accounts were situated at what Sternfeld calls the “Newtonian level”, i.e. the analysis of a manageable amount of sources integrated in a coherent narrative, digital methods have opened up new levels of analysis: from one single source (“atomic history”) to millions of documents and vast amounts of data (“astrophysical history”). The second concept, appraisal, concerns questions of contextualization. Scope and provenance are two important aspects for appraisal: knowing what material has been selected to be preserved in digital archives and being able to trace back the data to its origin.\nScale and appraisal need both to be thought in tandem and would, according to Sternfeld, allow for a more pragmatic approach in digital history. We would be able to move on the quantum scale of history.\n"

            en_us: 'In defending the book and its protocols of reading against the rise of the digital archive, Sven Birkerts worries that "in the theoretically infinite database, all work is present and available—and, in a way, equal." Rather than lamenting this fact, this essay argues that we might recognize such availability as the condition of possibility for cultural studies itself. After first theorizing about the "frenetic" reading practices generated by the digital archive, this essay then engages in an experiment: tracing the use of the word "imperialism" through the digitized version of a British weekly entitled The New Age. The results not only re-embed this now monolithic term in a more complex and unstable historical context, but also point to a new type of synchronic and non-linear critical practice.'

        abstract:
            en_us: 'The article recognises the importance of digitalisation for preserving and studying the past, but also wants to remind us that digitisation is changing the outlook of the archive and the methods and practices used by archivists and researchers. The author highlights four problems: (1) With digitisation a loss of (contextual) information is inevitable. Through scanning, using OCR and adding metadata analogue sources are digitally captured, but the choices that are made with regard to the metadata; the fact that search engines don’t preserve the hierarchy of traditional archives; and that physical aspects of a source (paper structure, watermarks, the method of binding, etc.) can’t be captured can become problematic issues. (2) Secondly it is important to understand that the analogue and the digital version of a document are not the same thing. Something that is often overlooked according to the author. The digital version is a copy of the original analogue document, and both should be treated as different types of sources as they come with their own heuristic and methodological approaches. (3) As a third point, the disappearance and marginalisation of analogue archival material is taken into account. In some cases the original objects disappear after digitisation, and although the author thinks it is important to consider if archival material needs to be preserved once it is digitally available, the traditional archive also has its value (i.e. the earlier mentioned ''physicality''). Another risk is that archives that aren’t digitised disappear “from our active cultural memory" because these analogue archives are often overlooked by researchers, creating the idea that they don’t exist. (4) Lastly, enormous amounts of time and money go into digital infrastructure (digitising archives, maintaining online accessibility), as well as the upkeep of analogue archival material, making digitalisation a very expensive undertaking. The above-mentioned problems make it necessary to rethink the idea of ‘mass digitalisation’, and lays an emphasises on critical reflection about which archives should be digitised and what the reasons are for doing so.'

        abstract:
            en_us: 'This article studies the transmutability or easy alteration of digital culture products and its economic value. In digital culture the audience creates value, which derives from a shared experience in a social process, and the community takes ownership and control over this culture. Whereas analog products are considered property of a single firm subject to copyright and technological barriers, digital culture goods are easily reproduced and distributed, and undergo endless modification, extension and recombination. Non-cost based pricing such as value-based pricing needs to counterbalance the near-zero marginal cost for digital culture products. After an evolution from art and music as public goods to the intellectual property of the music industry, fan communities are now transforming music and art back into public culture goods. Consumers of digital culture products can become significant creators and producers themselves. On the one hand, transmutability can be consumer-driven through unbundling, re-bundling, portability and distribution, personalisation and re-contextualisation. On the other hand, creator-driven transmutations include editing and re-editing, an extension of the original digital culture product, and recombination, remixing and sampling. The A2B2C (Artist to Business to Consumer) value chain in the traditional music industry, has now become an A2C (Artist to Consumer) chain where virtual communities of common cultural interest have access to digital products, and discover new products and rare works in a P2P (Peer to Peer) network. These derivative works have become widely available through IT at a low cost. Digital culture goods can therefore contribute to the value of the original products and the general brand or franchise, and open up new segments of the market. The challenge is to balance proprietary and open development models into new open source production models where transmutability is essential to benefit both producers and consumers. The compensation of creators and estimation of the value of these new contributions remains unresolved.'

            en_us: 'Web 3.0 seems so full of promise: If Web 2.0 replaced the static, client-based internet with a dynamic social web, Web 3.0 promises to expand the affordances of digital production, giving rise to increasingly complex modes of visual and aural representation, as well as to expand the networking capabilities that will replace the relative stability of desktops and databases with clouds and information flows.i Web 3.0 will be the Deleuzean “body without organs,” materializing human perception via stimulus-response, while more closely mimicking the organic pulse of the natural world. The brain becomes the neutral space in which the material and the immaterial meet and negotiate their terms. However the brain also becomes the control center, the mediator of the real and the virtual. So while there are at least three variations to the hype about Web 3.0, they all rely on the underlying view of the brain as the prime and only loci for a presumed human desire for transcendence. We humans seem hopelessly controlled by our brains and we are devoted to mapping their autonomic functions sufficiently for the twin purposes of exteriorizing our thoughts (via better representation), and interiorizing our lived experience (via deeper reflection).'
