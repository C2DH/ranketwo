    <h1>Introduction</h1>

    
    <div class="excerpt"><p>This platform offers lessons in digital source criticism, and invites you to explore the impact of digitization and of the world wide web on the way historians conduct historical research.</p>

</div>

    <div class='contents' id="contents">
    
<p>Questioning the authenticity of a document  by finding out who created it, at which time, for which purpose and in which context, has always formed the basis of critical historical scholarship. Now that we have unlimited access to data through the web, either to digital born or retro-digitized material, an additional layer of manipulation and interpretation needs to be questioned.</p>

<p><a href="/d/document-example"></a></p>

<p>A digital text, image or recording, may appear to be similar to its analog version, but is actually a collection of digits arranged in a particular order that offers a representation of the original that can be viewed on a screen, without its material characteristics.</p>

<p>Taking the analog object out of its original context, whether a private household, an archive, museum or library,  converting it to digits, enriching the result with meta data, and publishing it online so that  Google can index it, means that the object has undergone a whole series of changes that affect its appearance and informative value. Historians of the 21st century who will increasingly be dependent on digital data and non-textual sources, need to be aware of these changes and of the specific nature of digital objects.</p>

<p><a href="/d/document-example-b"></a></p>

<h2 id="information">information</h2>
<p>But there is more they need to master. Now that huge amounts of data can be collected and processed in no time, from any place with access to the web, regardless of the physical limitations of what a human brain alone can handle, historians need the skills to deal with these changes in terms of scale, speed and spatial context. In a way the changes in perspective could be compared to how the introduction of the microscope and telescope in the 16th century, changed the scale at which phenomena could be perceived and studied. Moreover,, applying digital methods to historical data, brings two worlds together that traditionally were each other’s opposites:  that of unique human lived experiences and expressions and that of mathematical calculations that can be reproduced. Combining the best of both worlds therefore asks for a broad variety of skills.
Consequently the  lessons we offer are a crossover between history, archival studies, ancillary sciences, information science and computer science.  In our view this multidisciplinary approach is necessary to foster a new generation of digital savvy scholars, who ask the right questions to digital content and are able to organize, analyse and present digital data with the help of digital tools.</p>
