### What is the objective of this lesson?

<!-- section-contents -->
The objective of this lesson is to teach students how the digital turn has affected the method of applying source criticism to a historical source. Source criticism comes down to asking questions about the origin, authenticity and informational and artefactual value of a source. When applying it to digital content an additional layer of alterations and transformations has to be identified and described. This lesson teaches learners the difference between attributing meaning to an artefact during its creation, its preservation and its digitisation. The assignments can be used to put this into practice with various types of data and in different digital environments.

### How is the content organized?

<!-- section-contents -->
The lesson consists of three modules with increasing level of complexity and time required.

The ***SMALL*** module consists of a short animation lasting 6 minutes 30 seconds, intended to be accessible to a broad audience, whether within a teaching context or not. It tells the story of how the historianâ€™s craft has changed and what we need to learn in order to be able to apply source criticism to digital sources. This is followed by a quiz that takes around 10 minutes.

The ***MEDIUM*** module consists of a series of eight assignments related to topics that are briefly discussed in the animation. The target group is Bachelor students in a humanities discipline and their lecturers. The assignments give learners the opportunity to engage with the topics in more depth, discuss them in class, read the literature and put the theory into practice. The assignments are suitable for collaborative work for two or three students. The time required varies from 30 to 90 minutes.

The ***LARGE*** module offers a tutorial for a hands-on workshop lasting at least a day. This requires a lecturer who has experience with digital tools, some preparation and preferably a computer lab with computers on which the required software is installed. The objective is to go through all the steps required to create a digital history project. This can range from creating a website or podcast or applying a storytelling tool to creating a digital exhibit or annotating a corpus of photos.
