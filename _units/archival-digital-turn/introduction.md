Lesson on how the method of source criticism has been affected by the digital turn and what this means for the practice of students who study humanities disciplines and conduct research.



***What is the objective of this lesson?***

The objective of this lesson is to teach students how the Digital Turn has affected the method of applying source criticism to a historical source. Source criticism comes down to asking questions to a source about its origin, authenticity, informational and artefactual value. When applying it to digital content an additional layer of alternations and transformations has to be identified and described. This lesson teaches to make a distinction between attributing meaning to an artifact during the context of its creation, its preservation and its digitization. The assignments offer the possibility to put this in practice with various types of data and in different digital environments. 



***How is the content organized?***

The lesson consists of three modules with increasing level of complexity and time effort.

The ***SMALL*** module consists of a short animation of 6,5 min, intended to be accessible to a broad audience, regardless of a teaching context. It tells the story of how the craft of the historian has changed and what we need to learn in order to be able to apply source criticism to digital sources. This is followed by a quiz that takes around 10 min.

The ***MEDIUM*** module consists of a series of 8 assignments coupled to topics that are briefly discussed in the animation.  Its target group are bachelor students of a humanities discipline and their lecturers. The assignments provide the possibility to engage with the topics more in depth, discuss them in class, read the literature and put the theory into practice. The assignments are suited for collaborative work for 2 or 3 students. The time effort varies from 30 min to 1.30 min. 

The ***LARGE*** module offers a tutorial for a hands on workshop of one or more days. This requires a lecturer who has experience with digital tools, some preparation and preferably a computer lab with computers on which the required software is installed.
The objective is to go through all the steps required to create a digital history project. This can vary from creating a website or podcast, applying a storytelling tool, to creating a digital exhibit or annotating a corpus of photos.
