The lesson is about the impact of digital technology on the historian's craft and the method of source criticism. It aims to teach students of humanities disciplines how the digital turn has affected the method of applying source criticism to a historical source that is published on the web. Besides the usual questions about the origin, authenticity and value of a source, one must ask questions about how the digitisation process has led to transformations of the source or, with regard to digital born sources, inspect the technological environment used to create the source.  
A short animation compares the digital turn to the archival turn at the end of the 19th century and also discusses the pivotal role of the German historian Leopold von Ranke. This theme can then be further elaborated by completing one or more of the seven assignments that deal with the transformation process from analogue to digital of different datatypes: photos, filmclips, interviews, emails, letters, diplomatic documents, newspapers and glass plates.
