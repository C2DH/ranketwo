This module offers guidelines and content to organise a two-day workshop with lectures, theoretical discussions and hands-on experiences on the concept of ‘digital source criticism’. The four assignments that are offered deal with:

1. Reviewing literature on the concept,
2. Visualising the technology of various digitisation processes,
3. Digitizing various data types,
4. Tracing the genealogy of the term and how it is applied in different disciplines.
