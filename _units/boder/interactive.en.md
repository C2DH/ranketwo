 Contrary to the quiz where the questions appear automatically, in this interactive version of the clip you need to click 
 on a rectangular black box with a white title that appears on the left lower corner of your screen.  If you click on it you
 enter a window with additional information on a specific topic. You need this information to complete your assignments.

The alternative to playing the clip and waiting until a box appears, is to click on  the index in the left lower corner of the screen. 
An overview of all the boxes and topics will appear just as shown below.

The  common theme of these topics is the transformation process of historical sources from their analogue form to their digital 
representation and how these changes are related to societal and technological developments.
As the clip covers a wide range of topics varying from physics, reproduction technology, historiography of the Holocaust, to 
interview methodology, the assignments can be connected to a broad variety of courses. 
Some will be well suited for Holocaust Studies or Historiography, others will fit better into a Media- or Information-  Studies 
approach. Lecturers can select what suits their purpose, through the tags in the metadata of each assignment.
