 **Read this Introduction before you enter this interactive animation!**

Unlike the quiz, where the questions appear automatically, in this version of the clip you need to click on a rectangular black box with a white title that appears on the bottom left corner of your screen to enter a window with additional information on a specific topic.
The alternative to playing the clip and waiting until a box appears is to click on the index in the bottom left corner of the screen, that shows an overview of all the 12 boxes and topics.

Since the clip covers a wide range of topics ranging from physics and reproduction technology to the historiography of the Holocaust and interview methodology, the assignments can be connected to a broad variety of courses. Lecturers can select the most appropriate assignment(s) by looking at the tags in the metadata.
