### What is the objective of this lesson?

<!-- section-contents -->

This lesson is meant to teach students to apply source criticism to audio interviews that were recorded with now obsolete technology in 1946, before being digitised and published on the web in 2000 and 2009. The central point is whether the meaning and value of an interview changes when it is transferred from its original context of creation to a context of preservation and eventually digitisation.

### How is the content organized?

<!-- section-contents -->

The lesson consists of three modules with increasing levels of complexity and time required.

The ***SMALL*** offers of a short animation lasting 6 minutes 30 seconds, intended to be accessible to a broad audience, whether within a teaching context or not. It tells the story of the various transformations of Boder’s collection of interviews. This is followed by a quiz that takes around 10 minutes.

The ***MEDIUM*** module is related to an interactive version of the first animation. The target group is Bachelor students in a humanities discipline and their lecturers. Topics that are briefly touched on in the short animation are discussed in more depth in twelve windows in the interactive version. Each of these windows serves as a basis for the following twelve assignments. These are suitable for collaborative work for two or three students. The time required varies from 30 to 90 minutes.

The ***LARGE*** module offers a tutorial for a hands-on workshop lasting at least a day. This requires a lecturer who has experience with digital tools, some preparation and preferably a computer lab with computers on which the required software is installed. The objective is to go through all the steps required to create a digital history project. This can range from creating a website or podcast or applying a storytelling tool to creating a digital exhibit or annotating a corpus of photos.
