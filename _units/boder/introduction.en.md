Lesson about how the collection of interviews with concentration camp survivors created by psychologist David Boder in 1946 has been turned into an interactive website in 2009.


***What is the objective of this lesson?***

The objective of this lesson is to teach students to apply source criticism to audio interviews that have been recorded with an obsolete technology in 1946, and have been digitized and published on the web in 2000 and 2009. Source criticism comes down to asking questions to a source about its origin, authenticity, informational and artefactual value. When applying it to digital content that is published online this requires an understanding of the alterations of the content during the various transformation processes. In this lesson we discuss whether the meaning and value of an interview changes when it is transferred from its original context of creation, to a contenxt of preservation, and eventually to a context of digitization.

***How is the content organized?***

The lesson consists of three modules with increasing level of complexity and time effort.

The ***SMALL*** module consists of a short animation of 6,5 min, intended to be accessible to a broad audience, regardless of a teaching context. It tells the story of the various transformations of Boderâ€™s collection of interviews. This is followed by a quiz that takes around 10 min.

The ***MEDIUM*** module is coupled to an interactive version of the first animation. Its target group are bachelor students of a humanities discipline and their lecturers. Topics that are briefly touched in the short animation are discussed more in depth in twelve windows of the interactive version. Each of these windows is the reference for the following twelve assignments. These are suited for collaborative work for 2 or 3 students. The time effort varies from 30 min to 1.30 min. In addition there is an animated video lecture on webtechnology with 4 assignments.

The ***LARGE*** module offers a tutorial for a hands on workshop of one or more days. This requires a lecturer who has experience with digital tools, some preparation and preferably a computer lab with computers on which the required software is installed.
The objective is to go through all the steps required to create a digital history project. This can vary from creating a website or podcast, applying a storytelling tool, to creating a digital exhibit or annotating a corpus of photos.
