***Why has this teaching material been created?***

The objective of this lesson is to teach students to apply source criticism to recorded interviews as sources of historical knowledge. This comes down to asking questions to a source to determine its origin, authenticity, informational and artefactual value. The teaching content revolves around a specific type of source, namely It explains how the meaning and value of an interview changes as it is transferred from its original context of creation to a digital environment that can be consulted online. When applying source criticism it is important to know about these transformations and alterations. More in general, the lesson also has the objective of teaching digital skills and some basic principles of communication technology and methods of research.  

***How is the content organized?***

The lesson consists of three modules with increasing level of complexity and time effort. 

The ***SMALL*** module consists of a short animation of around 6 to 7 min that is intended to be accessible to a broad audience, regardless of a teaching context. It tells the story of the various transformations of Boderâ€™s collection of interviews. This is followed by a quiz that takes around 10 min.

The ***MEDIUM*** module is coupled to an interactive version of the first animation. Its target group are bachelor students of a humanities discipline and their lecturers. Topics that are briefly touched in the short animation are discussed more in depth in twelve windows in the interactive version. Each of these windows is the reference for an assignment. These are suited for collaborative work for 2 or 3 students. The time effort varies from 30 min to 1.30 min.

The ***LARGE*** module offers a tutorial for a hands on workshop of one or more days.  This should be led by a lecturer who has experience with digital tools and requires preparation and a computer lab with computers on which the required software is installed. 
The objective of the tutorial is to go through all the steps required to create a digital history project. This can vary from creating a  website or podcast, applying  a storytelling tool, to creating a digital exhibit or annotating    a corpus of photos.
