An Exercise in Self-reflection: Personalizing and Localizing the topic (1,5 hour - BA -  laptop)


<!-- more -->

This assignment is meant to make you reflect on the sources of your own knowledge of the Holocaust and on how you became familiarized with the topic. This includes conducting some research on how the event is represented at present in your own social circle, city, region and country.
Document the answers to these questions: 

1. How did you personally get acquainted for the first time with the subject of the Holocaust? Describe the context: the place, time and medium and try to remember what struck you most: a particular story, film, monument, image or person. 

2. Do you know somebody in your family or social circle who is directly related to an experience in a concentration camp? What do you know about this person and how has this knowledge been shared with you?

What are the limits of your memory when you try to remember your first acquaintance with this topic? Who would you be likely to turn to, when trying to complement what you remember? Your siblings, parents, friends, or former teachers? What does this mean for the biography of your knowledge? Who has determined what you know about the subject? Why is knowledge about this topic regarded as essential in our historical culture? 
Find out and document whether there is a commemoration and/or monument related to lived experiences in concentration camps in your neighbourhood, town, region or country. When was this initiated and by whom? Is it connected to an event, a place or a person or more in general to a social group?

[](/d/document-example)

Find out and document whether there is a museum, archive or documentation centre in your neighbourhood, town, region or country that covers this topic and has a special collection of historical documents. 
What is it about? Does it include personal testimonies such as diaries, letters, memoirs, oral histories? 
Find out and document when the subject of the concentration camps with accounts of testimonies was first represented in newspapers, radio and television in your region, town and/country. 
In most countries National Libraries and Broadcasting Corporations have a published a digitized corpus or the catalogue of their material online.
