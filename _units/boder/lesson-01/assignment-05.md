Bring the images along that you have collected in the archive for the next part of the assignment 
Interview your parents and grandparents or other people you know well, belonging to different generations. Use a voice recorder to conduct at least 2 short interviews of about 10 min about how the narrator got acquainted with the subject of the Holocaust. Try and get as much historical context as possible: age, time and place, situation, peers, medium, reaction. You can use the scans of the front pages/articles/photos to stimulate the memory of your interviewees, but take into account the age and background of your interviewee to assess whether the newspaper article/photo will be recognized. This reminiscence method is  a well known technique to make peopleâ€™s memories resurface or to trigger associations.

After creating data by interviewing people, you also have to structure your data. This means that each interview has to be attributed a unique number according to a structure that you choose. You also have to document information about the interview: who, when, where, why and what is it about. This is called metadata and should be put in a metadata scheme that is bound to the document. By abiding to a specific standard and adding it to a document, the document becomes retrievable in a search environment.

Now  create a folder on your computer and place the table, the images, the sound recordings and their meta data schemes in it.  
The last step of this assignment is creating a slide presentation based on your findings that combines text,  images and links to audio and/or video.
