Visit an archive/museum/documentation centre in your surroundings to complement the research conducted for assignment 1. 

<!-- more -->

This can be either about a monument/commemoration, about a special collection, or about  a specific historical object (photo, diary, report, inventory). If there is nothing related to concentration camp experiences, then search for something related to Jewish identity or to war experiences of another persecuted social group. First consult the website of the institute and ask additional help from a librarian or archivist. This can be done by e-mail, by telephone or you may be able to make an appointment. 
When visiting the archive, be conscious of how the way you collect information is different then when browsing behind your screen (space, communication, use of your senses), take notes. 

If you are able to find material in the archive, make a picture it.  

Try and find additional information in the archive, articles/photos of historical newspapers with coverage of concentration camps experiences,  make a picture, or if this is not allowed, order a copy. Ask what the reason is for this limitation. 
Complement your research done for assignment 2. with a brief description of 500 words of what you have found in the archive (content) and a photo of it. 

Complement the table created in assignment 2, by completing additional fields with your findings  about the differences between web research and real life research in an archive (method).
