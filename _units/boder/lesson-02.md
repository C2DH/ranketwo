The digital form of data has made it possible to easily extract the various layers of meaning in spoken accounts. We can study the textual representation in the form of a written transcript, the aural representation of what is uttered by using tools to analyse the voices, and if recorded with video, through the visual representation, we can consider the facial and bodily expressions. Professionals who work with spoken accounts each have specific methodologies to extract and select what they regard as meaningful from audiovisual sources. Conventions between journalism, historians, linguists, psychologists and computer scientists differ strongly. But as the digital format is increasingly becoming accessible and easy to copy and reuse in different contexts, the borders between research communities are gradually disappearing. These series of assignments address three dimensions of testimonies on the Holocaust that are available in digital format: their multimodal character, the possibility to compare conventions with regard to interviewing across time, and the changes that occur when they are re-used in different media contexts.
