In various articles particular uses of language are discussed. Special attention is given to ‘terms’ that were not yet ‘coined’ in 1946, 
and to the fact that accounts were given in so many different languages.

- Read the following articles: Boder, Deblinger, Muller, Pinchevski, Kuhn-Kennedy and the first pages of Lanzmann’s text of the documentary
 which can be viewed online through Amazon (https://www.amazon.com/Shoah-Complete-Text-Acclaimed-Holocaust/dp/0306806657) 
 
- Choose two interviews of the David Boder collection with the help of keywords search in which the narrators describe what they experienced in a concentration camp. One in a language you master, one with the translation aligned with the audio. 
- First read the transcripts without the audio. Make a short note about your first impression of the interviews
- Then listen to the interview together with the transcript, in the language you don’t understand, 
- does it make any difference for your understanding of the emotional mood of the interview?  

- Then listen to the interview in the language you master with the transcript, 
- Does it make any difference for your understanding of the emotional mood of the interview?   
- Take notes about what terms are used to refer to what happened in the concentration camps 
  (example: do they use the term ‘gaschambers’? Or ‘lager’, or ‘trauma’? 

- Do the same with two interviews that more or less cover similar topics (use key words to select) in the youtube channel of the Shoah 
  Visual History collection. You may also choose two interviews from a different oral history collection that is available online, 
  for instance one in your own country. 
- Make notes at two levels:
- How your own perception and appraisal is influenced by language
- How the use of terminology differs between descriptions of concentration camp experiences in the Boder interviews and in the Shoah Visual
  History interviews
