**Read this Introduction before you take the Quiz!**

This quiz is designed to test your understanding of the topic. The animation is shown again, but this time it is interspersed with eight multiple-choice questions that appear on the screen and have to be answered before you can continue with the clip. Answering questions 1 to 6 is quite easy – the information that you need is conveyed in the passage just before the question appears. To answer questions 7 and 8, however, you need to remember details that are communicated throughout the clip. To answer these questions you can consult the transcript of the voice-over that can be accessed at [click on this link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1odeWHMhoGGiouWc5yjFdjr–Cs6W_RbPC9F5UmAOp7w/edit){:target="_blank"} **[NEED LINK TO PDF]**.
