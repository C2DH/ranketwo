Newspapers are imperfect recorders of history, yet they are a key asset for historical research. The digitisation of newspapers and their availability online has broadened the scope of historians exponentially. Yet, at the same time historians have to be conscious of what lies behind the search results that appear on their screen. The impression of 'completeness' can be misleading, as a digitisation project is always determined by particular choices. Digitisation also introduces some hurdles. Searching for articles on a given topic can be hindered by mistakes that have been made when applying optical character recognition (OCR). This lesson is meant to teach how various digital technologies have impacted the way we can access newspapers as historical sources, and which new questions we need to ask.
