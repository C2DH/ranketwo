The main learning goal of this tutorial is to enable historians and social scientists to gather Twitter data they can use as primary sources for research purposes or as teaching materials. The tutorial first introduces the reader to the Twitter application programming interface (API). Then it guides them through a first hashtag-based harvesting of tweetsand, finally, provides a basic analysis of the corpus of the collected tweets, by operating text mining operations and social network analysis.
