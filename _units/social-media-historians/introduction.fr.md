It offers a short clip, a quiz, and a series of assignments that deal with various perspectives on the phenomenon of social media: their historical and pedagogical value, their bias and bad reputation, the variety of platforms across the world, the pioneers, and their business model.
A more in-depth analysis is offered of Twitter, a microblogging service that can be accessed with a mobile application and is very much used in journalism and advertising.
