This lesson discusses the relationship between social media and the practice of academic historians from the perspective of source criticism, public outreach, and preservation. The objective is to teach historians how to make critical use of social media for their research. The lesson offers a short clip and a series of assignments that deal with social media from various perspectives: their historical and pedagogical value, their diverse uses, as well as the technological, cultural and economic variety of platforms that host them across the world. A more in-depth analysis is offered of Twitter, a microblogging service widely used for academic research.
