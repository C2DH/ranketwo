The clip and quiz you have just watched introduced several topics related to the main theme of this lesson: how digital technology facilitates the processes of transformation.The idea that a person, animal, or object can change its appearance has inspired artists, scholars, and inventors for centuries. With the advent of digital technology at the beginning of the 1990s, the ease with which one can create, manipulate, and share content online has ‘democratized’ the ability to transform reality. The plethora of web applications that are at our disposal allows us to ‘transform’ or ‘enhance’ reality into a virtual experience in a split second. At the same time, this freedom on the web and accessibility of tools can have a detrimental effect on the credibility of information that is spread, creating the risk of manipulating audiences by the spread of ‘fake news’. The following assignments deal with technologies, concepts, and practices that illustrate the advantages and disadvantages of digital cultures and highlight the timeless idea of transformation, from Greek mythology to computer algorithms. By learning  about image recognition software, creative commons licenses, social media, the history of fake news, and more, this lesson will explore how the idea of ‘transformation’ has itself been transformed by digital technology.
