### What is the objective of this lesson?

<!-- section-contents -->
The objective of this lesson is to reflect on the concept of 'transformation'. The idea that a person, animal, or object can change its appearance has inspired artists, scholars, and inventors for centuries. However, the combination of the ‘transformation’ concept and the advances in digital technology in the last thirty years have had a profound impact on the creative potential of these professions. Additionally, these developments have democratized the way in which people can express their creativity and respond to that of others. But the appeal of such affordances should be considered carefully. Especially in a scholarly environment where source criticism is essentia for building sound arguments, we need to know how credible and truthful sources are that are published online. The following assignments deal with technologies, concepts, and practices that have evolved with the advent of digital technology including image recognition, creative commons, social media, and fake news, and that are presented through poems, paintings, and digital applications highlighting the timeless idea of transformation.
