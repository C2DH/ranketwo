### What is the objective of this lesson?

<!-- section-contents -->
The objective of this lesson is to reflect on the concept of 'transformation'. Whether in the world of art or of technology, imagining a ‘transformation’ lies at the very heart of a creative process that can lead to a new invention. The introduction of digital technology offers us the possibility of transforming any entity into a malleable, transportable, and easy to decipher series of zero’s and one’s. But the appeal of such afforances should be considered carefully. Especially in a scholarly environment such as academic history, where source criticism is a basic requirement for building sound arguments, we need to know how credible and truthful sources are that are published online.
