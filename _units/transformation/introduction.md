Imagining a ‘transformation’ lies at the very heart of a creative process, of the wish to go beyond the ordinary and aspire the unimaginable. We can observe it in its natural form without human interventio
We can find it in stories, like in Greek mythology, where Gods can turn themselves and mortal creatures into animals or plants to discretely pursue their goals.   
A more recent playful example are the immensely popular ‘Transformers’, toys for boys representing vehicles that can instantly be turned into the most powerful robots. Even when we think of transformation in the real world,such as changing our gender or the form of our nose, 
what it all comes down to is having the power and means to shape and control new realities, 
The very possibility of hearing my voice and viewing these images,at any spot on the world where there is an internet connection, 
and of being able to stop, replay, copy and remix what I have brought together, represents such a reality, a reality that has been made possible by the introduction of digital technology. 
It is said that the possibility to transform any entity into a malleable, transportable, and easy to decipher series of zero’s and one’s 
represents a quantum leap forward in our quest to shape new realities, But how true is that? How real is the digital? 
How groundbreaking is the digital? And most important, can we trust the digital?


These kind of questions revolve around  a series of lessons that intend to teach how to be critical about digital sources of knowledge. More specifically, sources of knowledge for historians, our custodians of the representation of the past. 
They find themselves in  a hybrid world of professional practices, with the extinction of the paper library catalogue, 
but with 95% of the archives still in analog form. They rightly question the assumption of the radical transformation brought about by the digital and  the dichotomy between the analog and digital era. Talking about an ‘era’ suggests a kind of uniformity , as if the commonality of digitization -  every possible entity brought down to zero’s and ones - is projected onto the pre-digital era.  

A closer look at the distinct epistemological and material qualities of historical sources shows that the dichotomy analog versus digital is misleading. Before we had digitization, we had quite diverse expressions of tangible and intangible knowledge,
Consider the difference in materiality and representation between
