Whether in the world of art or of technology, imagining a ‘transformation’ lies at the very heart of a creative process that can lead to a new invention. The introduction of digital technology offers us the possibility of transforming any entity into a malleable, transportable, and easy to decipher series of zero’s and one’s. We are able to turn tangible artifacts and experiences into a virtual form. But the appeal of such afforances should be considered carefully. Especially in a scholarly environment such as academic history, where source criticism is a basic requirement for building sound arguments, we need to know how credible and truthful sources are that are published online. How have they been transformed from analogue to digital, by whom and for what reason? 
This lesson is inspired by the concept of 'transformation'. It deals with how technology has changed the way we communicate and transfer knowledge and how the 'digital' has created new encounters that seem real, but sometimes are able to deceive and seduce our senses.
