This lesson teaches the basic technology of the web to historians based on a case study in which two websites on the interview collection of the psychologist David Boder created in 2000 and 2009 are compared. It then explores the uses and challenges of web archives for historians.

An animated video lecture of 10 minutes offers an introduction to the basics of web technology. Then a series of assignments covers the history of the web, the technologies upon which it is based, and how to deal with web archives.
