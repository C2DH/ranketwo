This workshop was  part of the Digital History and Hermeneutics PhD skill training and has been held on the 30th and 31st of October 2017 at in the Digital History Lab of the Centre for Contemporary and Digital History. The Digital History and Hermeneutics Doctoral Training Unit is a four-year interdisciplinary training programme with 13 PhDs and 1 post doc coming from very diverse disciplines whose goal is to study how the application of tools and methods from data and computer science influence historical research. Translating the classical historical method of ‘source criticism’ to a research context in which historical sources are digitized or digital data is retrieved from the web, begs for a critical reflection on which new questions have to be asked and how technology affects the changes of the informational and artefactual value of the historical source. The four assignments that were completed by 5 groups dealt with 1. Reviewing literature on the concept, 2. Visualising the technology applied in the various digitisation processes with the help of sketches and drawings, 3. Using devices and technology to digitise four data types; text, images, sound and 3d objects,  4. Tracing the genealogy of the term and how it is applied/interpreted in different disciplines.

Core issues that were discussed: authenticity, ownership, changes in artefactual and informational value of a historical source when digitised, difference between digitised and digital born, copyright and reuse, metadata, databases, digital archives.  The skills training was coordinated by dr Stefania Scagliola, Andy O’Dwyer and dr. Tim van der Heijden.
