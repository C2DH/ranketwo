In the animation you have viewed you have been introduced to the very first recordings of testimonies of concentration camp survivors by David Boder and to how they have been transformed into a web resource. In the following lessons special attention will be given to this collection, but the overall approach is to more in general address the interplay between political agency and progress in media technology with regard to  audiovisual representations of accounts on the Holocaust in digital form. The objective is to teach students how to apply source criticism on audiovisual testimonies on the Holocaust that are retrievable on the web. Five iconic recordings of narratives and images of the Holocaust that can be found online, are the reference frame for the assignments. The following recordings have been created in different time periods, by different actors, with different technologies and different goals, and have all been recontextualised as digital objects on the web: 

1. the very first footage shot by the US army right after the liberation of concentration camps in Germany in spring 1945, 

2. the  sound recordings of David Boder from 1946 

3. the recordings of the trial of Eichmann in 1961

4. the documentary Shoah by Claude Lanzmann published in 1985

5. the Shoah Visual History collection of interviews initiated in 1999

The themes and concepts addressed in the assignments stem from a combination of disciplines: historiography of the Holocaust, media studies, history of technology, information science and digital history. Consequently, the assignments offer the opportunity to train skills that the ‘hybrid’ historian of the 21st century should master: reflexivity as consumer of historical knowledge, critical reading and writing, knowing his or her way around the library, archive, and web, conducting web research, critically assessing the origin and context of digital sources, collaborating online and applying digital tools for research, analysis,presentation and dissemination of research results. 

## What do we actually know about the origin of Holocaust Testimonies?

The sheer magnitude of the nazi- crimes and their prevalent place in our collective memory suggests that being knowledgeable about the Holocaust is inescapable and comes naturally. But from the very first film recordings of concentration camps, shot in spring 1945 by US allied forces to inform the American public, our knowledge about these events has been shaped by an interplay of political agency and technological advance. Each account that has been listened to or viewed in public spaces such as schools, museums or cinema theatres, or at home through the radio, television or computer screen, has a specific history of selection, duplication, adaptation and interpretation. This ‘hidden pedigree’ of a survivor testimony has been magnified by the advent of web technology and can only be reconstructed by tracing back the sequence and context of these changes and manipulations. By scrutinizing what lies behind the ‘click of the mouse’, historians should be able to assess the changes in the artefactual and informational value of a historical source when it is represented in digital form.  
The basis for the lessons is a thematic list of literature and web resources, with a short characterization to give the lecturer an impression of the content and to facilitate making a selection. This is followed by a series of lessons that each cover a different sub-theme and offer assignments to train different types of skills. Each assignment indicates the level of complexity, and the amount of time and resources that are needed.
