Boder’s approach shifted from that of a classical social scientist looking for evidence,
to that of an ethnographer documenting people’s expressions.
The footage shown in this box was shot in *Henonville*, but it only shows moving images of people.
In order to handle songs as historical sources , you need more information.
This assignment is meant to make students aware of the multimodal dimension of a source, and how the web
facilitates access to the different modalities and how copies of the material are created
so that it can be shown in different environments.
