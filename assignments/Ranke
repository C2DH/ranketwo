Eadward Muybridge laid the basis for the development of cinematography by making photos of a trotting horse with a series of 
cameras and showing them with a zoopraxiscope. Many artists, photographers and scholars were inspired by his work, but the 
impact and dissemination of his legacy was magnified after the introduction of digital technology and the web. 
This assignment is meant to study the relation between Muybridge’s original glass plates, and what can be retrieved,
viewed/read and re-used on the web.
