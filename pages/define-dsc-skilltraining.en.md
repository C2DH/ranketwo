On the 30th and 31st of October 2017 a skill training was organized for the PhD's of the Doctoral Training Unit Digital History and Hermeunetics on the concept of "digital source criticism". Here you can find a concise description of the skill training.

**PROGRAM**
Skills Training ‘digital source criticism’
Doctoral Training Unit DHH
by Prof. Andreas Fickers, Dr. Stefania Scagliola, Andy O’Dwyer 
30 + 31 October 2017

**Context**
The term ‘Digital Source Criticism’ refers to the critical appraisal of digital sources of knowledge that can be retrieved through the web. It obviously draws on the legacy of  Leopold von Ranke, the 19th century German historian who is regarded as the father of modern professional history. Through his seminars he introduced the archive as the habitat of the historian and rigorous fact checking as the essence of the historian’s craft. He is said to be responsible for the archival turn at the end of the 19th century, but at present we are confronted with the consolidation of a new transition: the digital turn.  
Adding the prefix ‘digital’ to ‘source criticism’ means that the traditional way of questioning the authenticity of a document by finding out who created it, at which time, for which purpose and in which context, no longer suffices. Additional layers of manipulation and interpretation need to be questioned. Historians of the 21st century need to be aware of how these transformation from analogue to digital affect the epistemological value and appearance of historical sources.  This skills training explores the meanings and practices of ‘Digital Source Criticism’. It poses the question how the digital turn requires a further reconsideration of the historian’s craft. The training is dedicated to PhD candidates with an interest in digital history and hermeneutics, source criticism, and digital literacy.

Keywords: digital source criticism, digital history, digital hermeneutics, digitization, multimodality, protocol, boundary objects, source collection, age of abundance.

**Organisation**
The skills training is organized by the DHH doctoral training unit and will be led by Prof. Andreas Fickers, Dr. Stefania Scagliola and Andy O’Dwyer. It consists of a two-day program, in which lectures and theoretical discussions are combined with hands-on demonstrations and group experiments. The first day is dedicated to literature and to  making sketches and drawings of how the digital affects the nature of a historical source.
The second day the participants are going to digitize various datatypes and reflect on their observations of this process and the differences between data types. The last part of the training consists of a crowdsourcing experiment in which the genealogy of the term Digital Source Criticism is going to be traced and documented. 

**Objectives** 
Get acquainted with the concept of ‘Digital Source Criticism’ its relation to the traditional form of source criticism and its various perspectives and conceptualizations.
Experience the transformation of a source from its analogue to its digital form.
Being able to reflect on and problematize this transformation from analogue to digital  of different source types (textual, visual, audio, object, online)
Being able to reflect on the relation between the analog archive, the web and your own hard disk (s). 
Being able to apply the principle of Digital Source Criticism to your own PhD research
