On 30 and 31 October 2017 skills training was organised for the PhD students in the Digital History and Hermeunetics Doctoral Training Unit on the concept of "digital source criticism". Here you can find a description of the skills training.

**PROGRAM**
Skills Training "digital source criticism"
Doctoral Training Unit DHH
by Prof. Andreas Fickers, Dr. Stefania Scagliola, Andy O’Dwyer
30 + 31 October 2017
participants: 16
Required: photoscanner, book scanner, 3d scanner, cassette/video player and software for analogue/digital conversion

**Context**

The term ‘Digital Source Criticism’ refers to the critical appraisal of digital sources of knowledge that can be retrieved through the web. It obviously draws on the legacy of  Leopold von Ranke, the 19th century German historian who is regarded as the father of modern professional history. Through his seminars he introduced the archive as the habitat of the historian and rigorous fact checking as the essence of the historian’s craft. He is said to be responsible for the archival turn at the end of the 19th century, but at present we are confronted with the consolidation of a new transition: the digital turn.  
Adding the prefix ‘digital’ to ‘source criticism’ means that the traditional way of questioning the authenticity of a document by finding out who created it, at which time, for which purpose and in which context, no longer suffices. Additional layers of manipulation and interpretation need to be questioned. Historians of the 21st century need to be aware of how these transformation from analogue to digital affect the epistemological value and appearance of historical sources. This skills training explores the meanings and practices of ‘Digital Source Criticism’. It poses the question how the digital turn requires a further reconsideration of the historian’s craft. The training is dedicated to PhD candidates with an interest in digital history and hermeneutics, source criticism, and digital literacy.

Keywords: digital source criticism, digital history, digital hermeneutics, digitization, multimodality, protocol, boundary objects, source collection, age of abundance.

**Organisation**

The skills training is organized by the DHH doctoral training unit and will be led by Prof. Andreas Fickers, Dr. Stefania Scagliola and Andy O’Dwyer. It consists of a two-day program, in which lectures and theoretical discussions are combined with hands-on demonstrations and group experiments. The first day is dedicated to literature and to  making sketches and drawings of how the digital affects the nature of a historical source.
The second day the participants are going to digitize various datatypes and reflect on their observations of this process and the differences between data types. The last part of the training consists of a crowdsourcing experiment in which the genealogy of the term Digital Source Criticism is going to be traced and documented.

**Objectives**

Get acquainted with the concept of ‘Digital Source Criticism’ its relation to the traditional form of source criticism and its various perspectives and conceptualizations.
Experience the transformation of a source from its analogue to its digital form.
Being able to reflect on and problematize this transformation from analogue to digital  of different source types (textual, visual, audio, object, online)
Being able to reflect on the relation between the analog archive, the web and your own hard disk(s).
Being able to apply the principle of Digital Source Criticism to your own PhD research

**Time schedule of the training**

DAY 1 Monday 30 October 2017 - Digital History Lab

09h10 – 10h45

**Introduction to ‘Digital Source Criticism’ -  the history of source criticism and its problematization from a digital history perspective**
Lecture Prof. Andreas Fickers
lecture 45 min - discussion 45

10h45 – 11h00
Coffee break

11h00 – 12h30
**A. Tag the Literature**

Teams will be formed with the task of tagging the literature that has been read, on the basis of the abstracts that have been written as preparatory work, and the thesaurus on Digital History:  http://www.dhlab.lu/dh-glossary/
In the last 20 min each team will present its results.

12h30 – 13h30
Lunch

13h30 – 15h00
**B. Source transformationfrom analogue to digital - Envisioning the phases of transformation**

The teams consider the objects/data/sources that they have brought along, choose a number of different data types, and attempt to make sketches of the phases of its transformation from analog to digital. The result should be a series of  drawings/sketches that help to visualize and  reconstruct the transformation process. White boards, digital bords and paper will be at your disposal. A number of websites will be listed where you can find information about electricity, light, sound and other physical processes.

15h00 - 15.20
**Source transformation: from analogue to digital (text, images and 3d)**

Lecture Andy O’Dwyer- Reflection on the life cycle from creation to presentation and transformations in materiality of three data types: text, images and 3d objects.

15h20 - 15h40
pause for coffee/tea

15h40 - 16h00
**Source transformations: from analogue to digital (oral history)**

Lecture Stefania Scagliola about Transformation of Sound
Reflection on the life cycle of the interview collection of David Boder, from steel wire to interactive webresource.  

16h00 - 16.30
integrate new insights, missing features
Adjust/correct visualizations. The teams have time to adjust/complement their schemes on the basis of new insights and prepare their sketches to present

16h30 - 17.00
**review of the results of the visualisations**

A team of specialists (Stefan Krebs, Daniele Guido, Andy O’Dwyer) will review results and give comments



DAY 2 Tuesday 31 October 2017 - Digital History Lab

9.00 - 9.10
Day overview - show clip ‘transformation’

09h10 – 12h00
**C. Actual digitization of data**

The exercise consists of tangible hands-on experiences with actual digitization processes with different data types: text, image, sound and 3d.  The groups are divided in teams and each team goes through the various phases of transformation, and documents its observations in a scheme.

10h15 – 10h30
Coffee break

12h00 – 12h30
**Discussion about how their practical experience has influenced their understanding of the transformation process presentation of the scheme of each team. Adjust/correct visualizations**

12h30 – 14h00
Lunch

14h00 – 16h00
**D. The genealogy of the term Digital Source Criticism - Evolution of the meanings of Digital Source Criticism**

The group is split up in teams, that each will  conduct web research, and consult a series of analog books and articles that will be provided, with the aim of tracing the origin and use of the term Digital Source Criticism, the combination of the three words, of the two words, and the separate words. The N-gram can be used for this purpose and some specific bibliographic search strategies.  The results will be turned into lemmas and inserted into a table. One of the PhD students will present the results.
These will be later reviewed by experts. If the members of the team agree, the results of this research could be published on the Ranke.2 Website on Teaching Digital Source Criticism, as a collaborative work of the PhD Doctoral Training Unit Group.

16h00 – 17h00
**Presentation of research on Digital Source Criticism to a team of specialists. Discussion of results**


17h00 – 17h30
**E. Evaluation**

Record short video-clip in pairs. Participants take their short description of their source that they have prepared in advance, read it out loud, and reflect on how what they have learned/experienced during the skill training, relates to their own source material  (3-minute) What is  the added value of the training for applying Digital Source Criticism to their own sources? This material is sent to a Google folder and can be the basis for the reflective report and a blog about the training.  

17h30 - 18.00
Drinks and Closing remarks
post training assignment
