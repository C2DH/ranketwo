Guiding principles for providing constructive feedback if you review a lesson for Ranke.2  

<!-- more -->

We may solicit your feedback for one of our lessons under preparation. This is because we value your expertise and we expect you to contribute to the overall quality of our resources. The reviewing process may either take the form of a direct and open exchange between all interested parties (author, reviewer, Ranke.2 editor) or be a blind evaluation (on demand of authors or reviewers). In any case, this is something to be decided by all the parties involved.      

We will of course appreciate your overall feedback, however, please note that we are especially interested to hear your views on the following aspects we consider important for a lesson. 

### Concept 
Please think of the lesson in terms of relevance and quality. 
* Does the lesson focus on a topic that is relevant to (digital) source criticism? Are there particular merits or important gaps you find? 
* Does the lesson focus on a type of sources of high relevance for teaching the historical method and (digital) source criticism? Does it seem localized to specific cases that might prove difficult to adapt in the classroom?     
* Does the lesson fill a void in the landscape of the open educational resources available for teaching (digital) source criticism?

### Structure 
Please think of the lesson in terms of clarity and efficiency. 
* Do the different parts of the lesson correspond to clear learning objectives? 
* Are the assignments of the lesson organized in a way that makes sense in relation with the learning objectives?
* Are the different parts of the lesson articulated in a logical way between them (for example, the different parts of a given assignment)? 

### Effectiveness
Please think of the lesson in terms of it achieving the learning objectives it fixes.  
* Are the learning objectives clear and realistic?
* Are the instructions clear? 
* Does the learning outcome correspond to the learning objectives the lesson fixes? 

### Resources 
Please evaluate the relevance, pertinence, and accessibility of the pedagogical and bibliographical resources the lesson uses (reading and viewing suggestions, hyperlinks, images). 
* Are the resources openly accessible? 
* Are the resources relevant for the topic and the type of sources the lesson treats? 
* Can the resources be realistically used for self-training or in the classroom in terms of length and clarity? 

### Multilingualism
Please check if the approach and the object of the lesson, as well as the resources it uses, allow for it being reusable in more than one languages.    
* Is the scope of the lesson relevant for different cultural environments? Can it fit different national contexts of learning and teaching history?  
* Are the resources (pedagogical and bibliographical) reusable in different languages? Are they too language-specific to be replaced by alternative resources in other languages (if available)? Do they need to be adapted or replaced? 
* Is the lesson fit for translation?
