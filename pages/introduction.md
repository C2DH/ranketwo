Each lesson focuses on a particular type of historical source and discusses how to apply source criticism to its digital representation.

### Why Digital Source Criticism?

The critical interrogation of historical sources has always formed the basis of historical scholarship. Questioning the authenticity of a source by finding out who created it, at what time, for what purpose and in what context is a key part of our research practices. Now that we have seemingly unlimited access to retro-digitised material and born-digital data through the web, we need to learn how to critically assess digital resources, just as we have always done with “analogue” materials.
A digital text, image or recording may appear to be similar to its analogue version, but it is actually a collection of digits arranged in a particular order that offers a representation of the original which can be viewed on a screen, without its material characteristics.
Turning an analogue object into a digital one entails a whole series of changes that affect its appearance and informative value. The analogue object is taken out of its original context, whether a private household, archive, museum or library. It is converted into digits, and the result is enriched with metadata and then published online.
Historians of the 21st century, who are becoming increasingly dependent on digital resources, need to be aware of these changes and of the specific nature of the digital sources they analyse in their research.


### The need to learn new skills

Today’s historians also need to master additional skills. Huge volumes of data can now be searched and collected in no time from any place with access to the web. Online collaboration with colleagues around the world is possible, as is the application of digital tools to create links between people, events and places. To fully engage with these changes in terms of scale, speed and space, historians need to develop new practices. These developments might be compared to the way in which the introduction of the microscope and telescope in the 16th century changed the scale at which natural phenomena could be perceived and studied.
Traditional approaches to research have not become obsolete. We still need to attentively read, analyse and interpret primary and secondary sources. We have to maintain our ability to sketch and to write with pen and pencil. We still need to visit archives, libraries and museums, since only a very small percentage of their sources have been published online. The best equipped historian is the hybrid historian, who knows how to combine traditional and innovative research practices.
Consequently, the lessons we offer on this website are a crossover between history, archival studies, ancillary sciences, information science and computer science. In our view this multidisciplinary approach is necessary to foster a new generation of digital savvy scholars, who ask the right questions when dealing with digital content and are able to organise, analyse and present digital and analogue data with the help of digital tools.


### Objectives

Students who complete one or more of these lessons will:

1. Understand how digitisation and the web have changed the nature of historical research
2. Learn how digital objects are created (retro-digitised, born-digital, converted documents) and how to question the concept of “original”
3. Learn how information is added to a digital object (metadata)
4. Learn how data is published online and made searchable
5. Understand the impact of search engines on finding and selecting sources
6. Understand the various phases of the historical research process and the tools that can be used for each phase
7. Be able to apply a number of digital tools to data in a basic way
8. Understand what these tools actually do with the data: the underlying mathematical and manipulative principle
9. Understand how the outcome of research can be presented in multimodal/transmodal non-linear narratives (storytelling) with the help of tools


### Key Terms
