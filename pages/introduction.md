**Ranke.2** is a teaching platform that offers lessons on how to critically assess and work with digital historical sources

### Why Digital Source Criticism?
Historians of the 21st century need to be aware of the specific nature of the digital sources they analyse in their research.
The critical interrogation of historical sources has always formed the basis of historical scholarship. Questioning the authenticity of a source by finding out who created it, at what time, for what purpose and in what context is a key part of our research practices. But now that we have seemingly unlimited access to retro-digitised material and born-digital data through the web, we need to learn how to critically assess digital resources, just as we have always done with “analogue” materials.

### Transformation from analogue to digital
A digital text, image or recording may appear to be similar to its analogue version, but it is actually a collection of digits arranged in a particular order that offers a representation of the original which can be viewed on a screen, without its material characteristics.
Turning an analogue object into a digital one entails a whole series of changes that affect its appearance and informative value. The analogue object is taken out of its original context, whether a private household, archive, museum or library, converted into digits,  enriched with metadata and then published online.

### The need to learn new skills
Now thath huge volumes of data can be searched, collected and shared in no time from any place with access to the web, historians need to develop new practices in terms of scale, speed and space. These developments might be compared to the way in which the introduction of the microscope and telescope in the 16th century changed the way at which natural phenomena could be perceived and studied.

### The hybrid historian
These changes do not mean that raditional approaches to research are becoming obsolete. We still need to attentively read, analyse and interpret primary and secondary sources. We have to maintain our ability to sketch and to write with pen and pencil. We still need to visit archives, libraries and museums, since only a very small percentage of their sources have been published online. The best equipped historian is the hybrid historian, who knows how to combine traditional and innovative research practices.

### Insights through crossovers
The lessons we offer on this website are a crossover between history, archival studies, ancillary sciences, information science and computer science. In our view this multidisciplinary approach is necessary to foster a new generation of digital savvy scholars, who ask the right questions when dealing with digital content and are able to organise, analyse and present digital and analogue data with the help of digital tools.

### Objectives

Students who complete one or more of these lessons will:

 1. Understand how digitisation and the web have changed the nature of historical research
 2. Learn how digital objects are created (retro-digitised, born-digital, converted documents) 
 3. Learn how to question the concept of the “original”
 4. Learn how information is added to a digital object (metadata)
 5. Learn how data is published online and made searchable
 6. Understand the impact of search engines on finding and selecting sources
 7. Be able to apply a number of digital tools to data in a basic way
 8. Learn how to critically assess the informative value of a website
 9. Learn the difference between conducting research in an archive and online
10. Learn about some basic principles of physics related to communication technology

### Key Terms
