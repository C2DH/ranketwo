This platform consists of  **Teaching Units** that offer teaching material about **Digital Source Criticism** with a variety of time slots and complexity. Each teaching unit starts off with a **short audiovisual clip** combined with a **quiz**, and is followed by a series of **assignments**. The last part consists of a **tutorial for a workshop** with the aim of creating a digital object.

### Why should we address the topic of Digital Source Criticism? 

Questioning the authenticity of a document  by finding out who created it, at which time, for which purpose and in which context, has always formed the basis of critical historical scholarship. Now that we have unlimited access to data through the web, either to digital born or retro-digitized material, an additional layer of manipulation and interpretation needs to be questioned. 

[](/d/document-example)

A digital text, image or recording, may appear to be similar to its analog version, but is actually a collection of digits arranged in a particular order that offers a representation of the original that can be viewed on a screen, without its material characteristics.

Taking the analog object out of its original context, whether a private household, an archive, museum or library,  converting it to digits, enriching the result with meta data, and publishing it online so that  Google can index it, means that the object has undergone a whole series of changes that affect its appearance and informative value. Historians of the 21st century who will increasingly be dependent on digital data and non-textual sources, need to be aware of these changes and of the specific nature of digital objects.

### The need to learn new skills

But there is more they need to master. Now that huge amounts of data can be collected and processed in no time, from any place with access to the web, regardless of the physical limitations of what a human brain alone can handle, historians need the skills to deal with changes in terms of scale, speed and spatial context. 

In a way this could be compared to how the introduction of the microscope and telescope in the 16th century, changed the scale at which phenomena could be perceived and studied. Moreover, applying digital methods to historical data, brings two worlds together that traditionally were each other’s opposites:  that of unique human lived experiences and expressions and that of mathematical calculations that can be reproduced. Combining the best of both worlds therefore asks for a broad variety of skills, a hybrid approach. 

Consequently the  lessons we offer are a crossover between history, archival studies, ancillary sciences, information science and computer science.  In our view this multidisciplinary approach is necessary to foster a new generation of digital savvy scholars, who ask the right questions to digital content and are able to organize, analyse and present digital data with the help of digital tools. 


### Objectives 

Students who complete one or more of these lessons will:

1. understand the impact of digitization and of the web on the role of the archive/archivist and on the methods of research for history/historians:
2. learn how digital objects are created (retro, digital born, conversion)
3. learn to question the concept of the ‘original’
4. learn how information is added to a digital document/object (meta-data)
5. learn how data is published online and made searchable
6. understand the impact of search engines on the selection of sources
7. understand the various phases of the research process and which tools you can use for each phase 
8. be able to apply a number of digital tools on data in a basic way
9. understand what the tools actually do with the data: the underlying mathematical and manipulative principle
10.understand how the outcome of research can be presented in multimodal/transmodal non-linear narratives (storytelling) with the help of tools.
