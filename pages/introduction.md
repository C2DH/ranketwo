**Ranke.2** is a teaching platform that offers lessons on how to critically assess and work with digital historical sources. Each lesson focuses on a particular type of historical source and offers a different perspective on digital source criticism.

## Why Digital Source Criticism? 

The critical interrogation of historical sources has always formed the basis of historical scholarship. Questioning the authenticity of a source by finding out who created it, at which time, for which purpose and in which context, is a key part of our research practices. Now that we have seemingly unlimited access to retro-digitized material and digital born data through the web, we need to learn how to critically assess digital resources, just as we have always done with ‘analog” materials.  

A digital text, image or recording, may appear to be similar to its analog version. But it is actually a collection of digits arranged in a particular order that offers a representation of the original that can be viewed on a screen, without its material characteristics.

Turning an analog object into a digital one entails a whole series of changes that affect its appearance and informative value. The analog object is taken out of its original context, whether a private household, an archive, museum or library. It is converted into digits, and the result is enriched with meta data, and then published online. 

Historians of the 21st century who will be, and already are, increasingly dependent on digital resources, need to be aware of these changes and of the specific nature of the digital objects they analyse in their research.



## The need to learn new skills

And there are more skills modern historians need to master. Huge amounts of data can now be searched and collected in no time from any place with access to the web. As a result, historians need the skills to deal with changes in terms of scale, speed and spatial context. In a way these changes can be compared to the way in which the introduction of the microscope and telescope in the 16th century changed the scale at which natural phenomena could be perceived and studied.

The lessons we offer on this website are a crossover between history, archival studies, ancillary sciences, information science and computer science.  In our view this multidisciplinary approach is necessary to foster a new generation of digital savvy scholars, who ask the right questions when dealing with digital content and are able to organize, analyse and present digital data with the help of digital tools. 


## Objectives 

Students who complete one or more of these lessons will:

  1. Understand how digitization and the web change the nature of historical research
  2. Learn how digital objects are created (retro, digital born, conversion) and question the concept of the ‘original’
  4. Learn how information is added to a digital object (meta-data)
  5. Learn how data is published online and made searchable
  6. Understand the impact of search engines on finding and selecting sources
  7. Understand the various phases of the historical research process and the tools that can be used for each phase 
  8. Be able to apply a number of digital tools to data in a basic way
  9. Understand what the tools actually do with the data: the underlying mathematical and manipulative principle
10. Understand how the outcome of research can be presented in multimodal/transmodal non-linear narratives (storytelling) with the help of tools.
