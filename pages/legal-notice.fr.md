The legal basis for processing personal data by using session cookies is Art. 6 para. 1 point f) GDPR (legitimate interest). Without the use of the session cookies especially, several functions could not be offered on our website.

A cookie is a small piece of data that a website stores on the visitor’s computer or mobile device.

**Persistent cookies**

Persistent cookies are saved on your computer and are not deleted automatically when you close your browser, unlike a session cookie, which is deleted when you close your browser.

### Google Analytics

- Google Analytics is a service which monitors and evaluates the effectiveness and efficiency of the C²DH website.
- This platform enables the protection of end-user personal data thanks to features such as IP address de-identification and a mechanism for users to opt-out so that their browsing is not processed for analytics purposes.
- Google provides information about the cookies used by Google Analytics.
- The cookies used by Google Analytics will be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the United States.

{: .extra-spacing}
### Privacy mesaures

Google Analytics is configured to use the domain “ranke2.uni.lu” and to store first-party cookies that expire after 2 years.

Cookies are used by the C²DH to track the following information about visitors. We use this information to prepare aggregated, anonymous statistics reports of visitor activity:

- IP address (masked)
- Location: country, region, city, approximate latitude and longitude (Geolocation)
- Date and time of the request (visit to the site)
- Title of the page being viewed (Page Title)
- URL of the page being viewed (Page URL)
- URL of the page that was viewed prior to the current page (Referrer URL)
- Screen resolution of user's device
- Time in local visitor's time-zone
- Files that were clicked and downloaded (Download)
- Links to an outside domain that were clicked (Outlink)
- Pages generation time (the time it takes for webpages to be generated by the webserver and then downloaded by the visitor: Page speed)
- Main language of the browser being used (Accept-Language header)
- Browser version, browser plugins (PDF, Flash, Java, …) operating system version, device identifier (User-Agent header)
- Language of the visited page
- Campaigns

**Do not track preferences**

Do not track is a function that allows visitors to opt out from being tracked by websites for any purpose including the use of analytics services, advertising networks and social platforms. Do not track options are available in a number of browsers including:

[Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/how-do-i-turn-do-not-track-feature){:target="_blank"}

[Internet Explorer](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/hub/4230784/internet-explorer-help#ie=ie-11){:target="_blank"}

[Chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/114836?hl=en&ref_topic=3421433){:target="_blank"}

[Safari](https://help.apple.com/safari/mac/9.0/#/sfri40732){:target="_blank"}

[Opera](https://help.opera.com/en/presto/be-safe-and-private/#notrack){:target="_blank"}

- If you enable do not track in your web browser, Google Analytics will respect your choice;
- If you have enabled the do not track function, you will not be tracked. This is in addition to your opting-out of the aggregation and analysis of data for our website statistics;
- If you have not enabled the do not track option but you choose to opt-out, the cookie ‘ga-disable-UA’ will be stored in your browser. All visitors with a ga-disable-UA cookie will not be tracked by Google Analytics;
- If you have disabled all cookies from your browser, we will still collect some general data about your browsing (e.g. a record of a visitor to our website) but they will be less accurate and your visit will not be tracked.<Paste>

**Restricted access to information**

All analytics data communication is encrypted via HTTPS protocol. The analytical reports generated can only be accessed through by authorised University staff dealing with Google Analytics or by duly authorised external sub-contractors, who may be required to analyse, develop and/or regularly maintain certain websites.

**Masking of IP addresses**

Note: Institution, city and country origin are determined from the full IP, then stored and aggregated before a mask is applied. Google Analytics uses an IP de-identification mechanism that automatically masks a portion of each visitor's IP (Internet Protocol), effectively making it impossible to identify a particular visitor via the sole IP address.

**Visitor log**

Google Analytics automatically deletes visitors' logs after 25 months. Anonymised and aggregated data are stored for an indefinite period by the University for analysis purposes.

**Contact**

Specific questions about the storage and use of Google Analytics data by the University can be sent to us by contacting us at [c2dh@uni.lu](mailto:c2dh@uni.lu).
