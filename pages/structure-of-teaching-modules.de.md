Each lesson offers a choice of several modules with an increasing level of complexity and time required

<!-- more -->



The lessons have been structured in such a manner that they can serve the needs of students, lecturers and independent learners with limited time, as well as those who really want to study a topic in depth. Each lesson can consist of a SMALL, MEDIUM or LARGE module.

## SMALL

The **SMALL** module serves as a short introduction to a topic related to source criticism. It consists of a short animation of around 6 to 7 minutes in which a number of basic terms and questions are presented. This is followed by a quiz of around 10 minutes to test learners’ understanding of the ideas conveyed in the animation. The SMALL module is geared towards a broad audience with a general interest, including individual learners who are not part of a teaching context.

## MEDIUM

The **MEDIUM** module is meant to be used in a teaching context and therefore offers information for both students and lecturers. It consists of a series of assignments that address the various topics introduced in the animation in more depth. Its target group is Bachelor students and their lecturers. The assignments are suitable for collaborative work for two or three students and the time required varies from 30 to 90 minutes. Each assignment provides specific information about learning outcomes.

## LARGE

The **LARGE** module offers a tutorial for a hands-on workshop lasting at least a day. This should be led by a lecturer who has experience with digital tools and requires some preparation and an appropriate environment such as a computer lab. The objective of the tutorial is to go through all the steps required to create a digital history project. This can range from creating a website or podcast by applying a storytelling tool to creating a digital exhibit or annotating a corpus of photos.

## How can you use the lessons?

A lecturer can choose one or more modules and/or assignments that can be completed and discussed in class or given as homework. The following considerations may help lecturers to choose the material they wish to use:

1. How the topic of digital source criticism fits into a given course (for example an “introduction to research methods”, as generally offered in the first year of a Bachelor programme). For a number of suggestions, see section .......

2. The level of digital savviness of students and lecturers – for a quick digital literacy test that your students can take, see section .......

3. The amount of available time – see the metadata of each assignment for information about the time required.

## How to choose an assignment?

As these lessons are not compulsory and there is no teacher available to monitor progress and offer feedback, lecturers should themselves assess how to integrate the content into their own lessons. To guide lecturers in their choice, each assignment offers metadata about the time required, learning outcomes, key words and practical requirements. There is also the option of downloading a PDF of the assignment in order to integrate it somewhere else. Downloadable templates are provided for students to complete their assignments.
