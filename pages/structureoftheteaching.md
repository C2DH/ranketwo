**Ranke.2 - Structure of the Lessons** ; Each lesson consists of several components with an increasing level of complexity and time effort   

<!-- more -->

## What does each component have to offer? 

The teaching modules have been structured in such a manner that they can serve the needs of students,lecturers or independent learners with limited time, as well as those who really want to study a topic in depth. Each module can consist of a SMALL, MEDIUM or LARGE component.

## SMALL   
The **SMALL** module consists of a short animation of around 6 to 7 min that is intended to be accessible to a broad audience, regardless of a teaching context. This is followed by a quiz that takes around 10 min.

## MEDIUM  
The **MEDIUM** module consists of a series of assignments that address topics that are presented in the animation. Its target group are bachelor students of a humanities discipline and their lecturers. The assignments are suited for collaborative work for 2 or 3 students and the time effort varies from 30 min to 1.30 min.

## LARGE
The **LARGE** module offers a tutorial for a hands on workshop of one or more days. This should be led by a lecturer who has experience with digital tools and requires some preparation and an appropiate environment such as a computer lab. 
The objective of the tutorial is to go through all the steps required to create a digital history project. This can vary from creating a  website or podcast by applying a storytelling tool, creating a digital exhibit or annotating a corpus of photos.

## How can you use the modules?

A lecturer can choose one or more modules or assignments that can be completed and discussed in class or can be given as homework. Considerations for the lecturer to choose which material to use can be: 

1. How the topic of digital source criticism fits into a given course (most applicable is the subject ‘introduction into research methods’   
that is generally offered in the first year of a bachelor study) - see for a number of suggestions section .......
2. The level of digital savviness of pupils and lecturers - see for an easy survey on digital literacy for your students to take section .......
3. The amount of available time - see for the time effort the meta data of each assignment

## How to choose an assignment?

As these lessons are not bound to enrolment and there is no teacher available to monitor progress and offer feedback, lecturers should assess themselves how to integrate the content into their own lessons. To support a lecturer’s choice, each assignment offers metadata about the time-effort, learning outcomes, key words and practical requirements. There is also the possibility to download a pdf of the assignment, in order to integrate it somewhere else. The same applies to a template that students can use for completing their assignments.
