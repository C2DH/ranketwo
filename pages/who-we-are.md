The Luxembourg Centre for Contemporary and Digital History  O<sup>2</sup>) C<sup>2</sup>DH is an interdisciplinary research centre at the University of Luxembourg. It serves as a national platform for debating topical issues in contemporary Luxembourgish history and for advancing the development and training of digital literacy among students and researchers at the University of Luxembourg. As a “trading zone” for historians and computer scientists, humanities scholars and data scientists, the C2DH aims to set new standards in the area of digital history. This involves a hands-on approach to digital tools and research infrastructures in the field of contemporary history and an openness to experimenting with new forms of historical storytelling and public engagement. The concept of “thinkering”, or playful experimentation with technologies and digital tools, provides a basis for the development of digital hermeneutics and for critical reflection on how digital technologies affect the way in which we think about, narrate and “do” history.

## Leopold von Ranke revisited: Ranke.2

The Ranke.2 teaching resource is the result of a project initiated by the Director of the C2DH, Andreas Fickers, with the generous support of the Rectorate at the University of Luxembourg. The aim of the project is to develop an open-source online teaching platform for [digital source criticism](http://ojs.viewjournal.eu/index.php/view/article/view/jethc004/4). Ranke.2 is particularly designed to reach out to [lecturers and students](https://www.science.lu/fr/youtube-en-tant-que-source/les-chances-les-risques-dune-historiographie-numerique) by offering teaching content that can be easily integrated into academic curricula, but it is also suitable for independent learners.
