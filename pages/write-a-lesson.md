If you are about to author a lesson for Ranke.2, please check the following section where we provide guidance that hopefully will be useful to you, if you wish to contribute a lesson to Ranke.2. The [first part](#Overall-scope) offers a general view on the identity and form of the lessons we publish.  


## Overall scope
### Purpose
The lessons of Ranke.2 target an audience of beginners to introduce to the critical approach of historical sources in the digital age (digital source criticism). Each lesson can focus on a given type of historical source and its digital representation(s) - for example, diplomatic correspondence in electronic form. The lessons aspire to either be used for self-training or in the classroom (as they are or adapted in their scope and data). 

Working with sources in form of digital data frequently involves building specific skills and acquaintance with various methods and techniques, i.e. how to conduct network analysis with your data or how to work with geographical information systems. Developing such specific skills **is not** the principal vocation of Ranke.2 - we focus mainly to **why** and **in what purpose** one might have to develop such skills. If, however, parts of your lesson involve considerable technical aspects, you have the possibility to provide separately a specific how-to tutorial that we can publish distinctively from your lesson and link to it. We have such tutorials about, for instance, how to collect social media data or how to work with the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine. Note, however, that in most cases this is not necessary and you can simply recommend skills building lectures in your bibliography, if necessary. <!-- not forh=get to encourage to use resources of PH, Dariah Campus...)-->.  

### Structure
The lessons consist in general of a short animation - this is the introduction - and a series of assignments that go deeper - this is the heart of the lesson.  

The video animation offers a 5 minutes long general introduction to the topic and can address even a non specialized audience. Please note that we do not expect you to prepare this type of resource for us: we may need [a little help from you](#Conceive-and-write-down-a-narrative), but the video production is responsibility of the Ranke.2 team. 

As for the main lesson, it proposes assignments that aim to guide readers through what the transformation of a historical source to a digital representation may involve and what historians should consider while applying source criticism. You might want to use our [handout for teaching digital source criticism](https://ranke2.uni.lu/assets/pdf/C3.1-visual-aid-3.pdf) as a reminder for the questions one ought to have in mind but feel free to build your lesson in a way you consider it makes sense for your topic. 

### Multilingualism
Ranke.2 is available in three languages: English, French and German. Although most of the lessons were first written in English, beware that you can write your original lesson in either of these languages and we shall do our best to have it translated into the other two within a reasonable timeframe. Indeed, as the video animations, the translation of the lessons is our responsibility and we use the services of professional translators. However, if for any reason you wish to provide a translation you prepared yourself, in addition to your original version, please let us know in advance. In any case, beware that your lesson has vocation to be available in more than one languages, and we kindly ask you try in advance to [anticipate its translatability](#Anticipate-translatability) whenever possible - we acknowledge however that not everything has necessarily vocation to be translatable. 

### Open resources
If you provide images, data, viewing and reading suggestions or if you propose use of specific software or technical environments, please note that these should be open, non commercial resources. Complementary readings may of course include bibliographic references one can consult in a library. However, any reading/viewing resource (journal artcile, video...) or technical environment (digital archive, bibliographic database...) that is necessary to use prior to accomplishing an assignment should be openly accessible. 

### Why publish on Ranke.2
Ranke.2 is neither an electronic journal nor an open repository - consequently, you may have questions about the status of your publication. Publishing with us is akin to making publicly available, and sustainable, educational resources on a shared domain of pedagogical interest with editorial help and a flexible system of quality control. From a legal point of view, we ask you to sign a contract that recognizes your moral rights and guarantees that no one will exploit commercially your work. From a quality point of view, we ensure: a) editorial control and formating (Ranke.2 team), b) constructive review pre publication (it can be either open or blind but this is something we can discuss together), c) professional copyediting and translation services.                

## Conceive your lesson

Conceive and organize a lesson can be challenging. This is why we gathered below some instructions that we hope will prove useful to you. The aim is to achieve an easy-to-follow, pedagogically effective tutorial that hopefully will last - as much as possible - in time.     

### Choose a title and prepare an abstract 
Think of a short title that describes your lesson with clarity and precision. This element should allow the targeted audience to spot your lesson easily and judge if it is of interest to them. The title is also important for making your lesson discoverable in the web and we would be happy to discuss it with you and make suggestions if necessary. We also ask you to provide a very short abstract in ideally one phrase to complete the title and describe the scope of your lesson briefly but well. For both the title and the abstract, please keep your expression simple and avoid very sophisticated or ambiguous sentences.  

### Select the topic and fix the learning objectives
Please spot the type of historical source your lesson deals with and define carefully the topic you wish to highlight. You can also identify the specific part in the process of a historical research (search, analyze, interpet, disseminate, preserve) your lesson principally focusses on: this will help you to fix the learning objectives of the lesson and then build the assignments correspondingly. We suggest that you avoid going beyond three principal learning objectives in order for your lesson to gain clarity and cohesion. For example, the lesson [From the shelf to the web, exploring historical newspapers in the digital age](https://ranke2.uni.lu/u/exploring-historical-newspapers/) focusses on the historical source: press and the broader topic of how the digitization of large press corpora affects the ways historians search their sources and compile their own corpora. This lesson chose to deal with the chalenges a historian may have to face during the phase of search of their sources. Its main learning objectives are to help historians understand the process of digitization, the way search environments work and, finally, how to cope with different search interfaces.  

### Define the structure of the lesson
Your lesson should ideally be long of 4 000 - 6 000 words maximum. Please provide an introduction and well-defined sections, each of them dealing with a given aspect you consider important for your topic. Three to five sections can give an efficient, as well as easily reproductible lesson. Each section ought to propose one or more assignments and we recommend you do not go beyond three or so. If necessary, provide reading and viewing suggestions that allow to fulfill the assignments or gain more profound knowledge after. You can find in the following useful advice about [how to write your lesson](#Write-you-lesson) and how to choose the complementary resources if any. You can also use a template we prepared for you in order to clearly distinguish the structure of a lesson.  

### Conceive and write down a narrative
How would you narrate your topic and the essence of your lesson in five minutes to a non-specialized audience? The lessons may propose a short video animation (or a simple visual or voice recording) of some five minutes to offer a very general introduction to the topic of the lesson. Thus, we propose that once you have finished writing your lesson, you work on a one-page narration that we can use to prepare the audiovisual resource of your lesson. This will be a great help for us and will guarantee that the video animation follows the spirit of your approach. But the exercice will provide you also with a useful and reusable output in various contexts (classroom, workshop, presentation...). If you are unable or unwilling to do this, we will work on such a narration ourselves but beware that we may ask you to review it. In any case, we are happy to provide guidance for the steps to take during this process.


## Write your lesson 

Below we provide details on what the philosophy of our lessons entails and, hopefully, what can be useful advice to prepare the contents of a successful lesson.  

### Introduction
Please provide an introduction where you present your topic, the way it relates with traditional source criticism and how this is relevant in the digital age. For example, does your case highlight continuities in applying the historical method or transformations due to the sources transforming to digital historical data? If so, in what ways? And, if not, what does this reveal about the historical prectice in the figital age? If your lesson can build on one or more of our existing resources (lessons, video animations, how-to tutorials), feel free to associate them. Take care to briefly present the assignments, so that the audience knows what to expect. You should also outline the learning objectives and what one will have gained in knowledge and skills after accomplishing your lesson. Our lessons target a beginners level and you should assume that the readers do not have in depth knowledge of your subject. If for any reason prior acquaintance with tools and methods is required, please include relevant information in this part. Ideally, the introduction should consist of three tight and not too long paragraphs. 

### Assignments
The assignments of your lesson illustrate how you propose to apply the historical method on digital sources from a practical point of view. Consider them as the core of your lesson. Ideally, they should provide insights on historical context, theory, method and tools, and invite to reflect on the evolution of technology and its impact on how one works with historical data.  

#### Organize your assignments
Depending the subject, the scope and the learning objectives of your lesson, it is up to you to decide how many assignments you wish to propose. Keep in mind that the lessons should be no longer than 4 000 -6 000 words. Also, ideally, they should be executable in no more than two hours, albeit it is difficult to estimate the effective duration of a lesson as many parameters can be at play (continuous or intermittent availability of a user, context of use, number of users, individual level of knowledge, prior knowledge and skills requirements...).  Thus, we encourage you to organize your lesson around no more than 3 to 5 assignments.  

It is up to you to decide if the assignments of your lesson should be linked in an evolutive way (for example, the first assignment should be accomplished prior to the second etc.) or federated (in case you approach your topic via diverse angles). To enhance effective use of your lesson, a good tactics is to think your assignments as possible to execute in 20- 30 minutes each, with clear pedagogical objectives. This way, they can fit easily in a class or workshop context or find a place in busy individual schedules.  

<!--In case an assignment is composed by sub-assignments, you should distinguish these as "a." "b."...The assignments should consist of a mix of questions relating to historical context,
method, technology, theory and reflection.
Each assignment should refer to one or more questions from context 1, 2 or 3 (see
illustration above).
The first element is a brief introduction. This can also include a link to an existing
clip that helps provide a general idea of the topic. Sections a, b and c of the assignment then follow. It is preferable to make a clear distinction between parts a, b and
c, with the first being the most flexible and doable assignment that can be completed anywhere, individually. The rest of the assignment can consist of more complex
options, requiring collaboration between students. Lecturers have the option of
assigning just the “a” sections to students, avoiding issues of logistics and time
constraints-->  

#### Keep the lesson focussed, provide clear instructions
Please avoid to only provide a list of links and tasks to do and try to keep your audience focussed on the learning goals of your lesson. Do not forget to use simple language and explain clearly the steps your audience has to follow to complete the assignments. Remember that you initiate your readers to your topic and they need to be provided with necessary context and clear instructions. If, for instance, you suggest source criticism should be applied to a given dataset, please specify where the dataset is available, how a reader can access it, what the dataset is about and what is the historical context that makes it an object of study. If necessary, provide examples and be precise about what a reader should expect to acccomplish. 

#### Tools criticism
If you propose use of digital methods or tools, take some time to present them briefly, explain why and how they are useful for historians and assess them critically. 
 
#### Federate educational resources 
While explaining the digital methods or tools, you might find it useful to recommend tutorials for the readers who would like to learn more and we encourage you to do so. Do not waste time and space to formulate from the scratch knowledge that is already available elsewhere. [*Programming Historian*](https://programminghistorian.org/), for example, or [Dariah Campus](https://campus.dariah.eu/) provide useful tutorials for historians and we welcome use of any open educational resource of high quality standards.   

#### Open access reading/viewing suggestions 
You may need to provide the bibliographical/web references and any resources you think are necessary for the audience to follow your lesson (datasets, images, graphics...). Preferably, the bibliographical and web references should be in open access and have persistent identifiers (such as DOI and permalinks) in order to provide a lesson that will remain sustainable and accessible to all. If you provide datasets, these should be openly available data. Finally, make sure that any images you provide are under no restrictive rights. If, in spite of your efforts, it is necessary to obtain rights of use for any resource you wish to use, please get in touch with us beforehand to discuss your project.   

### Style of bibliographical references and notes
Please provide the bibliographical references you use/recommend in a separate section at the end of the lesson. We use the Chicago Manual of Style 17th edition and, if you are not sure how to format your notes and bibliography, a [quick guide](https://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/tools_citationguide.html) is available online. But in any case, what matters is to provide the references and we will be happy to format them for you if necessary.   

## Lesson files
You should ideally send us the text of your lesson in a file formated in Markdown syntax. If you are not sure how to do this, please take <a href="mailto: ranke2@uni.lu">contact with us</a>. Should the use of Markdown be a barrier for you, feel free to write your lesson in a text format you are confortable with and we will convert it for you. Please, when you send us your lesson, provide a separate file for the lesson text and separate folders for images and data. For the images, please use explicit names to name the files and provide a list of them including the legends you wish to use for each in your text. To name your lesson files prefet to use the [kebab case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_case#Kebab_case) naming convention. To give an example, the files of our lesson "From the archival to the digital turn" are named as follows: `archival-digital-turn`


## Anticipate translatability

 Ranke.2 has the ambition to be available in three languages. Our experiences, some of them more and some less succesfull, have taught us useful lessons. The most important is that lessons are challenging to succesfully work in different cultural environments, frequently subject to diverse scientific traditions, at least in the humanities. However, this is not impossible either. The best means to assure a lesson can be succesfully and adapted to another language and cultural context is to anticipate this in its conception. Here follows what we consider useful advice.
 - the resources you provide (data, tools, reading suggestions etc) ought to be flexible to either fit larger cultural frameworks than the one they are product of; or to be interchangeable with resources adapted to different languages and scientific traditions
 - your approach ought to fit domains of studies that have an international scope or outreach (connected histories, international history...) as this makes it easier to find points of contact - and resources - between different languages 
- the technical environments you use ought to be fit various language environments (for exemple, the Historical newspapers lesson mobilizes a datavase of newspapers in French, German and Luxembourgish; the lesson on web archives uses both international and localized examples)
- the images that illustrate your lessons ought to be understood in larger cultural frameworks than the one they are product of or at least not so central to make it impossible to replace them.  

Please take these instructions seriously while you conceive your scope and assignments and select your pedagogical resources. If you can indicate us alternative resources for the translations of your lesson, this would help us greatly to prepare the translations quickly and respecting the spirit of your lesson. We acknowledge that not everything is translatable and we are not likely to exclude a lesson of great pedagogical value that could work in some cultural environments but not in others by the nature of the sources or the technologies it uses. However, we thank you in advance for every effort you can spare beforehand to anticipate the translation of yoyr lesson.
