Guiding principles for authoring a lesson for Ranke.2  
 
<!-- more -->

Below you will find the guiding principles we developed for authors that we hope will help you write a clear and efficient lesson. The first part present the general educational purpose of the lessons of Ranke.2: what they are and what they are not, their specific multilingual vocation, their commitment to openness and their structure. This information defines the general framework of Ranke.2 and defines our expectations from the authors as for the general scope of their lessons. The second part provides more specific instructions as to how to conceive and build a lesson from the scratch.  

## General scope of the lessons
    
### Educational purpose
Offer an introduction to the critical approach of historical sources in the digital age (digital source criticism) is the main purpose of the educational resources of Ranke.2. Each lesson focusses on a specific type of historical source and its digital representation(s) - for example, diplomatic correspondence in electronic form, digitized oral histories... The lessons aspire to be used either for self-training or in the classroom and target an audience of beginners.

The lessons [consist of a short video animation and the main lesson](https://ranke2.uni.lu/about-lessons/) in which a series of assignments dig deeper into the selected topic. The video animation is principally **our responsibility**, note however that we may need [a little help from you](#conceive-and-write-down-a-narrative) mostly to assure the result is compliant with the spirit of your approach. The main lesson and its assignments is what is **your principle responsibility**. You might want to use our [handout for teaching digital source criticism](https://ranke2.uni.lu/assets/pdf/C3.1-visual-aid-3.pdf) as a reminder for the questions one ought to have in mind, but feel free to build your lesson in a way you consider it makes sense for your topic and the historical method aspects you wish to highlight. 

The lessons **do not** involve building specific technical skills to conduct research with various digital humanities methods and techniques (i.e. network analysis, geographical information systems etc.). Rather, their focus is mainly on **why** and **in what purpose** one might have to develop such skills to be able to apply source criticism. If, however, your lesson encompasses considerable technical aspects, you can always prepare a how-to tutorial that we can publish apart. For instance, we provide a tutorial on the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine that is associated to the lesson on web archives. Note, however, that in most cases you can simply [recommend skills building tutorials published elsewhere in your reading/viewing suggestions](#federate-educational-resources). 

### Multilingual vocation
Ranke.2 is available in three languages: English, French and German. What does this mean for you? First, you can write your lesson in either of these languages. Second, we assure the translation of your lesson into the two other languages of Ranke.2 and we try to do so within a reasonable timeframe. Finally, precisely because your lesson has vocation to be available in three languages, we kindly ask you to [anticipate its translatability](#anticipate-translatability) whenever possible, as we acknowledge that not everything is necessarily translatable. 

## Conceive your lesson
Conceive and organize a lesson can be challenging. This is why we gathered below some instructions that we hope will prove useful to you. The aim is to achieve an easy-to-follow, pedagogically effective tutorial that hopefully will last - as much as possible - in time.  

### Select the topic and fix the learning objectives
Please spot the type of historical source your lesson deals with and define carefully the topic you wish to highlight. You can also identify the specific phase of a historical research your lesson principally focusses on (search of sources, analysis, interpretation, dissemination, or preservation). Defining precisely these elements allows you to fix concrete learning objectives and build the assignments correspondingly. We suggest that you avoid setting more than three principal learning objectives for the sake of clarity and coherence. 

For example, the lesson [From the shelf to the web, exploring historical newspapers in the digital age](https://ranke2.uni.lu/u/exploring-historical-newspapers/) focusses on the historical source: press. It deals with the topic of how the digitization of large press corpora affects the ways historians search their sources and compile their own corpora. Thus, the lesson identifies specific challenges a historian may have to face during the phase of searching their sources. Its main learning objectives are to help historians understand the process of digitization, the way search environments work and, finally, how to cope with different search interfaces.    

### Define the structure of the lesson
The structure of the lesson should anticipate a length of 4 000 - 6 000 words maximum. Please provide an introduction and well-defined sections, each of them dealing with an aspect you consider important for your topic. Three to five sections can give an efficient and easily reproductible lesson. 

Each section ought to propose one or more assignments and we recommend you do not go beyond three or so. 

If necessary, and we recommend you do so, please provide reading and viewing suggestions that help to fulfill the assignments or to gain more profound knowledge. The following section provides useful advice about [how to write your lesson](#write-you-lesson) and how to choose the complementary resources if any. You can also use a template we prepared for you in order to clearly outline the structure of a lesson. 

### Anticipate translatability
Ranke.2 is available in three languages. It is a challenge to make lessons successfully work in different cultural environments that can often be subject to distinct scientific traditions. Thus, anticipate this possible impediment as soon as a lesson is conceived can be key for being able to effectively adapt the latter to other languages and contexts. Below follows what we hope can be useful advice.
 1. The examples of historical research and approach you highlight in a lesson ought to be fit for an international scope or outreach. This makes it easier to find contact zones between different languages and available resources. Connected histories, international or transnational history, and interdisciplinary domains can provide such case studies, although there can of course be many more.
 2. The pedagogical resources of the lesson (data, tools, reading suggestions, images etc.) ought to be flexible to either fit larger cultural frameworks or to be interchangeable with pedagogical materials available in different languages. It is crucial that you use this kind of resources to demonstrate your point, rather than organize your assignments around powerful but not necessarily generalisable materials.
 3. The technical environments the lesson may use ought to be functional in various language environments. For example, the digitized historical newspapers lesson mobilizes a database of newspapers in French, German and Luxembourgish; the lessons on web archives and David Boder use both international and localized examples.
 4. If you have knowledge of alternative resources (datasets, reading and viewing suggestions, etc.) we can use for the translations of your lesson, do not be shy to indicate us. 

 We acknowledge of course that not everything is translatable and we are not likely to exclude a lesson of great pedagogical value solely on this ground. However, we thank you in advance for every effort you can spare beforehand to enlarge the scope of your lesson and its usability. 

## Write your lesson 

Below we provide detailed advice on how to develop the contents of your lesson.  

### Introduction
Please provide an introduction where you present the type of sources you deal with, the topic and the main learning objectives that [you have carefully defined while conceiving your lesson](#select-the-topic-and-fix-the-learning-objectives). 
Do not forget to mention the way the topic relates with traditional source criticism and how it is relevant in the digital age. Does your case highlight continuities in applying the historical method or transformations due to the sources transforming to digital historical data? If so, in what ways? If not, are there specific questions raised? For example, what does this reveal about the historical practice in the digital age?

You should also outline the learning objectives and what one will have gained in knowledge and skills after accomplishing your lesson. Our lessons are fit for a beginners level and please avoid to assume that the readers have an in depth knowledge of your subject. If for any reason prior acquaintance with tools and methods is required, please mention this.  

In the end of the introduction, you can briefly announce the structure of the main lesson with the assignments, so that the audience knows what to expect. If your lesson builds on one or more of our existing resources (lessons, video animations, how-to tutorials), feel free to mention the association and provide links. 

Ideally, the introduction should consist of three tight and not too long paragraphs. 

### Assignments
The assignments are the core of your lesson, as they illustrate how you concretely propose to apply the historical method on digital sources. They should consist of a mix of questions relating to historical context, method, technology, theory and reflection. 

The assignments constitute the sections of your lesson. It is up to you to decide how many assignments you wish to propose. We encourage however you organize your lesson around no more than 3 to 5 assignments, that can also be split to sub-assignments, as we explain below. You are also free to choose if the assignments, and consequently the sections of your lesson, should be linked in an evolutive way (if, for example, the first assignment needs to be accomplished prior to the second etc.) or federated (in case you approach your topic via diverse and rather autonomous angles). Keep in mind that the entire lesson should ideally be executable in no more than two hours, albeit this is difficult to estimate, as many parameters can be at play: continuous or intermittent availability of a user, context of use, number of users, individual level of knowledge, prior knowledge and skills requirements... To enhance effective use of your lesson, a good tactics is to think your assignments as possible to execute in 20- 30 minutes each, with clearly defined pedagogical objectives. This way, they can fit easily in a class or workshop context or find a place in busy individual schedules. 

An assignment may be composed by short sub-assignments. In this case, you should enumerate these as "a." "b." and son on. The first element is a brief introduction. Remember that you initiate your readers to your topic and you need to provide necessary context and clear instructions. Parts a, b and c (or more if necessary) of the assignment then follow. It is preferable to make a clear distinction between these parts, with the first of them being the most flexible and doable in a determined duration, thus being possible to be completed individually or in the context of a classroom. The rest of the assignment can consist of more complex options, requiring for example collaboration or more lengthy readings. Think of part "a." as a basic element that needs to be taught and the rest as options to go further. You have the possibility to provide specific reading and viewing suggestions for each assignment and we encourage you do so. 

Please avoid to only provide a list of links and tasks to do and try to keep your audience focused on the learning goals of your lesson. Do not forget to use simple language and explain clearly the steps one has to follow to complete the assignments. If reading or viewing a resource is a task necessary to complete an assignment, make sure that its length is adapted to the time that is estimated for completing the exercice.   

If you propose use of digital methods or tools, take some time to present them briefly, explain why and how they are useful for historians and assess them critically.

### Use open resources
Perhaps you provide images, data, or you base your assignments on viewing and reading suggestions. You may even propose use of specific software or technical environments. In this case, please note that these should be openly accessible, non commercial, and preferably freely licensed resources. Complementary readings may of course include bibliographic references one can consult in a library, if not immediately available on the web. However, any reading/viewing resource (journal article, video...) or technical environment (digital archive, bibliographic database...) that is necessary to use prior to accomplishing an assignment ought to be openly accessible. 

Make sure that any images you provide are under no restrictive rights. If, in spite of your efforts, it is necessary to obtain rights of use for resources you wish to use, please get in touch with us beforehand to discuss your project. 

Please note that it is preferable to use resources with persistent identifiers (such as DOI and permalinks) in order to provide a lesson that will remain sustainable and accessible. 

### Federate educational resources 
While explaining the digital methods or tools, you might find it useful to recommend tutorials for the readers who would like to learn more and we encourage you to do so. Do not waste time and space to recreate from the scratch knowledge that may already be available elsewhere. [*Programming Historian*](https://programminghistorian.org/), for example, or [Dariah Campus](https://campus.dariah.eu/) provide useful tutorials for historians and we welcome use of any open educational resource of high quality standards.    
  

## After you write your lesson

### Choose a title and prepare an abstract 
Think of a short title that describes your lesson with clarity and precision. The title is important for the audience to spot your lesson and quickly judge if it is of interest to them. It is an important element for making your lesson discoverable in the web and we will be happy to make suggestions if necessary. 

We also ask you to provide a very short abstract, ideally one phrase or two, to complete the title and describe the scope of your lesson briefly but well. For both the title and the abstract, please keep your expression simple and avoid very sophisticated or ambiguous sentences. 
 
### Conceive and write down a narrative
How would you narrate your topic and the essence of your lesson in five minutes to a non-specialized audience? The lessons may propose a short video animation (or a simple visual or voice recording) of some five minutes to offer a very general introduction to the topic of the lesson. Thus, we propose that once you have finished writing your lesson, you work on a one-page narration that we can use to prepare the video animation that will be the introduction of your lesson. This will be a great help for us and will guarantee that the video animation follows the spirit of your approach. But the exercice will provide you also with a useful and reusable output in various contexts (classroom, workshop, presentation...). If for any reason we are the ones to produce this narration, we may ask you to review it. In any case, we are happy to provide guidance for the steps to take during this process.

### Send us the lesson files
Please provide separate folders for the text of the lesson, images and data. Specifically for the images, remember to use explicit names to name the files and provide separately a list of the captions you wish to use for each in your text. If you are familiar with the Markdown syntax, you are welcome to send us your lesson in this format; if not, feel free to use a format you are acquainted with and we take in charge the rest! For any query and additional information, please take <a href="mailto: ranke2@uni.lu">contact with us</a>.
